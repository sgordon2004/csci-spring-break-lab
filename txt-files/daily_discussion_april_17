I have been at home for 4 weeks now wondering why I had to get laid off and slowly lose my savings. 28,000 Americans die a day, 33,000 have died in total over the course of 3 months. That is an average of 367 deaths a day, or 1.3% death rate for Covid. I pray for all the people who have died or lost loves ones. But.......... Just like the 1% of wealthy people that effect the economy, this 1% of people who have died will also weaken the economy just as much. Your kids and maybe even your grand kids have just been dropped into a lower class of wealth than what you had just 3 months ago. Even if your were barely making it in January, you might not have anything by January 2021. The wealthiest have also just gotten richer by buying back into there own companies at an extremely discounted rate, and these large companies do not have to worry about going out of business because your tax money is paying to keep them afloat. Those $1200 dollars you got from Daddy Trump, well he gave those companies on average $18000 per person for a bailout. He could have given everyone in this country $20000 and let those companies that were greedy fail. Good luck everyone, the longer this goes on, yes more lives will be saved, but many more will be homeless, increase cases of suicides, with paper money that may be more useful to burn for heat or wipe your ass with, then spending $10 on a dozen of eggs with the inflation that is about to happen to this country. Yes I'm ranting, so still be responsible, stay at home, protect yourself and others if you go out, wear ppe. Make plans for the future, only buy necessities, be smart, good luck everyone.

Its not just deaths from the flu, it is the medical system absolutely overloading due to too many sick, too fast, then its not just deaths from the flu, imagine everyone on earth gets it, and fast.. we are talking so much death that the economy takes generations to recover, or never recovers at all.. straight up horror movie collapse of civilization without these preventative measures.

The death rate is actually 0.3 percent because there are millions of asymptomatic cases. Antibody tests prove this

You can have a 100,000,000 million cases, The percentage is based off off total deaths a day in America(28000) and average deaths per day for COVID(367) over a three month period, which is 1.3%.

it's even less than that, Santa Clara county reports 3.9% official mortality, but that might be overstated 50-85 times based on the latest study

How would we ever prove a country could unleash a virus as part of a war tactic? It seems genuinely impossible to prove? Could viruses be used as a weapon? To me - it seems like the perfect weapon... it can cause craziness and nobody can ever 100% blame you without making some degree of assumptions.

The US military and I‚Äôm sure others looked into it. They even did some limited tests during the first Iraq war. Bioweapons have been rejected as a viable weapon due to a lot of factors, but the main one is that it‚Äôs too hard to contain and prevent blowback to your own troops and population. There are just so many other easier ways of crippling a country without the risks. Like flooding them with counterfeit money to cause massive inflation - also has been done to Iraq.

Of course they could. And yes it would be pretty hard to prove.

Why does it seem unlikely to you? Not doubting you, just genuinely interested in learning what took place for it to be considered unlikely.

Trump did the trade war and it seems to me it pissed off china. Now the USA corn and soybeans are at multi year lows while China corn and soybean futures are at multi year highs.

One small example.

It's unlikely as bioweapons are very unreliable - either it's not contagious enough or too contagious and risks affecting your own country negatively. Any rational military knows this. There are far easier ways of disrupting your enemies. Look at how good Russia's been doing with pushing US citizens to extremes of both the left and right on social media.

If you're interested in a paper on the history of biological weapons, you can start here and then follow the references. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326439/

American Karens: "IF YOU SAY SCHOOLS SHOULD RE-OPEN, YOU ARE A MURDERER! HOW DARE YOU!"

Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and France: "We disagree. Many children can't learn at home, because they don't have WiFi or laptops. Other children are vulnerable to abuse at home. Or can't access social services. It is sensible -- with appropriate precautions -- to re-open schools, especially given children are at very low risk for the disease."

This shit sucks :(

Obviously I'll do what I need to do to keep myself and my family safe.

But this is making my depression and anxiety so much worse.

Who knows how long this will last? I'm worried for my own family, my other family members. I'm worried that my elderly grandparents will die before I get a chance to see them again. They've only met my son once and that was months ago.

I worry for my mom who has no choice but to go out and has health problems.

I'm just worried.

I'm honestly confused by most of the videos I've seen. Less patients is to be expected. People aren't going to the ER as much out of fear, elective procedures have been cancelled, routine visits have been cancelled, visitors aren't allowed, and most intake of actual covid patients is not going to involve then sitting forever in a waiting room. We should expect parking lots, waiting rooms, and large sections of hospitals to be mostly empty.

Now, if a hospital in NYC that claims to have too many patients is exposed and outright lying and making up patients, that would be something. But showing a random hospital in a random town having an empty waiting room doesn't "expose" anything.

The part that's actually scary is at 0:57, he's like "this video is going to get removed."

One of my employees claims that wearing a face mask makes him nauseous, by my boss is saying that starting tomorrow he'll be required to wear one. Is my employee pulling my leg to get out of wearing one, or is wearing a face mask something that will make you nauseous?

Americans attacking Sweden is laughable. None of the US ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù are enforced ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need a permission slip to visit the grocery store and police can‚Äôt fine you for spending all day running or biking. U.S. ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù policies are effectively the Swedish policy, but without the benefit of Swedish trust/compliance/responsibility, elements of Swedish social and political culture. Really silly for Americans to attack Sweden when, assessed objectively, there is more social distancing happening in Sweden ‚Äî with no formal lockdown ‚Äî than in the U.S. states with ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù policies.

How safe is getting takeout food? Obviously tons of people are doing it...but if it's safe, why exactly? What if theres a careless worker that somehow contaminates the food (or inside of the food container) in one way or another AFTER cooking it?

Is there still some reason that it is unlikely to infect you through the food, other than hopefully being killed by heat? Does it not infect through oral consumption easily or something?

I have taken to ordering comfort food from skip the dishes, door dash ,etc once or twice a week. I only order stuff you can reheat and santize all boxes that come in the house. Wear a mask if your going in an elevator and do contactless delivery is possible. Wash your hands often and I think it's pretty safe.

The virus bind to Ace2 receptors which is mostly in your airway, there is some in the nose and mouth which is why people are told not to touch their face, but the chance that the virus could bind to one of those receptors is low, chewing and swallowing would probably be too fast. You also produce saliva during chewing which has some antivirals in it.

coronaviruses don't spread that way. Is it possible? Yeah. Is it probable? No. So the short answer - it's safe enough.

I am in the same boat. We consider it every 4-5 days because we would be craving something, but never end up doing it because I am not convinced that it is so safe. I have thought about immediately microwaving the food, because shouldn't that definitely kill the virus? But, it's generally not worth the risk, in my opinion.

there's no studies done on this topic specifically.The topic is contiguous.

I'm sure food safety guidelines are strict in most countries, but having worked in several kitchens... I'm not confident at all consuming food that has been handled directly by anyone else.

That's really how I feel as well, I just have family here that are almost begging to get food delivered because they just can't stand eating at home for this long. I'm of the mind that it's just not worth the risk. If there were studies giving legitimate reasons (other than "health standards" that are supposed to be followed to the T by a bunch of minimum wage workers) why food is safe, I would maybe change my mind about it though :/

I have a solution for your family. I‚Äôve done this twice since February for the same reason but here goes it. Order carry-out where you pay on-line. Only order hot food, nothing else. Take a mask and gloves to pick it up . Have someone waiting with oven safe cookware. Dump the contents (pizza or wings or pasta, etc.) into the oven safe dishes and re-heat at 400 degrees for 5-7 minutes stirring the pasta if need be. Immediately throw away the packaging in outside garbage cans along with the gloves and mask. Take a shower and wash laundry if you feel necessary.

Do contactless delivery.

Put food on your own plate.

Wipe down whatever the container touched

Wash your hands multiple times during the process.

Risk of transmission via food is very very very very very low.

Even if the food you are had the virus on it after all that, it would be swallowed and sent to the stomach where the gastric juices would kill it

I would already be doing all of those things, but do you have any sources that build on that last bit of info?

I don't doubt that if it comes into contact with stomach acid that it would be killed, but with how much I've heard about avoiding touching my face I'm wondering how you could NOT be infected with the virus all over the mucus membrane that is the inside of your mouth?

So. how do we get over this?
Vaccine / immunity from having it? May not work, or at least, it will be like the other Coronaviruses (like Flu) that don't offer lasting immunity. Even if a vaccine does work, it may have to be be renewed every year as the virus mutates, so we'll be dealing with it forever.

The other way is to starve it to death with aggressive test, trace, isolate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE-cA4UK07c This stop victims from infecting others, makes it possible to avoid it, so it whould eventually die out due to a lack of hosts.
Unfortunately, this would take a national effort, which is unlikely to happen here.

You are essentially correct. This ends when:

We have tested and isolated all carriers. Probably too late to do this in the US, but other countries have done it successfully.

A vaccine is found and enough people are vaccinated that the rest have herd immunity.

Enough people are infected and either die or recover that the rest of us have herd immunity.

That's it. Those are the only way this ends.

America is going to burn to the ground, and there‚Äôs Jack crap any of us ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs‚Äù can do to prevent it. No one listens to our voices, those who do don‚Äôt want to do anything lest their social status gets hurt. This is the first true panic fear I‚Äôve felt my whole short life. And then the hypocrisy that‚Äôll happen once brain dead followers and nay say-ers get smacked in the sternum. Why are those who are higher up so quiet, obedient, never has their own thoughts? And those that do disappear! WHY ARENT MORE PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS? What dumbasses what the country opened right now, right this second because I want to go to Spain and buy expensive useless designer shit!! I had to get this out of my system.

I'm not sure what reality you are living in, but many people who are very 'successful' in life (if you count money as success, which you probably do) are quarantining and worried about the virus. Now, I know you wont/can't respond, but I can prove it very easily to you-

Israel Is Now Reporting That The Trump Administration Reached Out To Them Back In November To Warn Them About Impending Pandemic

The Times of Israel claims Israeli television reported tonight that US intelligence agencies warned the country of an impending pandemic with coronavirus, gaining speed in China, a startling five months ago.

‚ÄúThe US intelligence community became aware of the emerging disease in Wuhan in the second week of that month and drew up a classified document,‚Äù the report alleged.

Resistance has developed to nearly all specific and effective antiviral agents

Resistance has developed to all drugs against HIV, and treating hepatitis B with nucleoside analogue monotherapy gives rise to drug resistant variants

Resistance develops rapidly when viral replication is not maximally suppressed

Drug resistant viruses may be transmitted

Assays to measure drug resistance are available in specialised laboratories

Also, consider that these are confirmed cases. Likely, those infected is 5-10x that amount but are either a symptomatic or not sick enough to require hospitalization and testing. Therefore, when things settle down you‚Äôll likely have a large part of the population who have already contracted and recovered from the virus.

That's a good thing, if social distancing is kept up cases will start to drop.

That's what's so frustrating about relaxing restrictions right now , just as we're finally seeing the peak. If we continue we will see a very fast drop of cases and deaths but if we relax we'll see this long slog of a plateau when we could have really drove this virus down to very low levels while we wait for a vaccine.

Judging by the amount of protests happening around the country I think we are in for another large spike, along with a potential too early re-opening which could lead to another lockdown toward the later part of the year. It‚Äôs so sad to see.

Anyone know how long this shit will last?

Ok, so, I haven¬¥t been tested for corona, and my roomate hasn¬¥t been tested either. But both of us got sick at about the same time, he was like one week ahead of me getting the disease.
All the symptoms are the same as described in corona.
Got a runny nose, headache and fever on first day sick. Was sick with fever for about a week, then after that it got a bit better, then a tightness in the chest with slight coffing occured, and that was coming back and forth for about two weeks.

So after week 3 , it should¬¥ve been fine, went for walks but had to take it slow due to the chest not feeling that good.
Both of us have now been going back n forth feeling sick, feeling better, ( Never fully "ok" ), Stomachpains where it feels like the stomach is infected, + slight coffing and shortness of breath as soon as physical activity such as walks or such is done. During walks we have to take breaks and stop and wait for a minute from time to time, ( during 20 minute walks ).

I have been "sick" like this for 6 full weeks now, and he is on the end of his 7th week.
Yesterday he had a bit trouble breathing during the day and felt sicker, then it eases up and it¬¥s "ok" or "better" for a while, but it is still always present, just not as accute.

None of us is that worried, since we have done the worst part, so there¬¥s no real stress or such activating panic or anything. Just general feeling of not being able to actually move about or strain the body.

TLDR; Been sick for about 6-7 weeks, still having symptoms in chest with shortness of breath and coffing comming and going. Not tested for corona, but 99.9% certain that it is corona, due to symptoms. Both male 25-30 years old, active training regularly, pretty fit, lean, no real previous conditions that makes us risk groups.

Anyone know how long this shit can last? WHO says 2-6 weeks, but this doesn¬¥t feel like it¬¥s easing up...

Just so you know athletes die from exercising with pneumonia, this is no different. Not only that but you risk spreading it to somebody else.

Google healthy athletes die from pneumonia and you will see how fast it can happen. Go get a test or stay inside until it gets better; boosting your heart rate and bp will only lessen your immune system.

If you want to do anything take a steamy shower or put a hot wash cloth over your face and breath. If your body temp gets high drink a glass of cold water or switch to a cold shower but keep your body temp low.

Hopefully you were walking alone in a secluded area.

I live in Osaka, Japan and today there was an ambulance outside my apartment for quite some time. Maybe not covid but it still feels like a bad omen. Many ambulances can't find hospitals for corona virus patients because hospitals beds or full or because the hospital refuses to accept them.

In another anecdote, one of my wife's friends said that he breathing was painful and everything tasted like lemons. Pretty sure this poor bastard has corona. I hope he can get the help he needs to fight the virus.

In Spain is only people that tested positive, independently of location.

In practice, it means the majority of people that died in nursing homes has not been included, specially during the first weeks (now they are using fast tests and testing more in general, so maybe the reporting is a bit better now.)

We alcohol wipe stuff that needs to go in the fridge, the virus is stable for weeks in the refrigerator, and longer in the freezer, otherwise we just leave it out for a few days, washing hands after handling them.

Absolutely, you have 2 options, clean everything with a bleach wipe or soap/water or let it sit for at least 24 hours. I have a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù drawer in my fridge. It‚Äôs a mild risk of transmitting but, for now, don‚Äôt take the risk.

But don't they say that it can live up to 9 days on plastic surfaces? I have a friend in Spain who told me that they have their stuff delivered and placed in the back of their car (only canned food and e.g. toilet paper), and they don't touch it for nine days. I'm not kidding.

And does it really matter at the end of the day? If it was so contagious that you need to go to these extreme measures for every single object that is outside your house then you either already had it, are going to get it and either way more than likely are going to be fine. What are you going to hold up in your house for the next year and only going to go outside in a bubble?

My aunt thinks that the number of people whom have died from the coronavirus is equal to the number of people who would have died from old age, or other illnesses, furthermore, she thinks that more people are dying due to neglect and lack of available healthcare. She thinks that the media is blowing this out of proportion. I used the mass graves in New York as an example, and she thinks that those people could have been given proper burials.

check out overall death rate for a given region. compare the month of march for the last few years, and this year. The point is clear that whatever is out there is killing many more people than normal.

Also just the number of infections of healthcare workers in the US. People thinking that the only excuse for shutting things down is something with an astronomically high death rate are incredibly naive. Just look at the impact this has had on healthcare facilities with lockdowns being established. We can‚Äôt handle the rate that people are trying to get into hospitals because the amount of people becoming infected.

The US response to the entire COVID crisis has been the perfect example of government penny wise pound foolishness.

Just imagine if we spend 4 billion dollars every year to have all the infrastructure in place and ready to deal with any outbreaks. Let's say there is 1 COVID or Spanish flu like outbreak every 100 years. This mean we would spend about $400 billion over 100 years (not including inflation).

How many trillions have we spent now in the past month? We could have prevented all of this with just a minor investment by comparison of a few hundred billion.

A lot of people are under the misconception that a lockdown is to prevent people from contracting it. The lockdown is to buy hospitals time to get ready for patients and prepare, preventing people from getting it is just an accessory to that. That‚Äôs why no there will not be a lockdown until a vaccine is developed, that‚Äôs why countries are starting to reopen because they‚Äôve built the infrastructure to deal with patients in the lockdown time period

Serious question - if getting Covid-19 apparently cannot guarantee immunity (according to WHO at least in saying antibody tests might be pointless) then how does a vaccine, which introduces a souped-down version of a pathogen to stimulate immunity, work and what's the point of it?

If getting actual Covid-19 itself doesn't give you immunity then what is the point of waiting for a vaccine to give you a weak version of Covid-19 to give you immunity, as it would appear pointless if you already fought off its big brother without having boosted any immunity?

The mixed messages around this subject are very annoying!

For one thing, antibody presence is not equal to immunity, some people have no antibodies but can quickly mount up an immune response when they are re-exposed. Also, we don't actually need guaranteed immunity, we just need some immunity in most people. For example, the flu vaccine is only 30-40% effective and only about 35% of the population gets it, but that is enough to bring the R0, aka the virus reproduction rate, from something that will spread and kill widely to something that will burn itself out.

We don't know with Covid19 yet, but there is probably going to be some months or years of immunity for a large proportion of people. That good enough from a controlling spread perspective, and we might have to re-vaccinate regularly, like we do with the flu, but it should work well enough.

New seroprevalance test from Santa Clara County California suggests that somewhere between 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected in early April. The county is reporting 69 deaths right now. That would put the mortality rate between .09-.14%. Good news if true.

Right around 3% prevalence of antibodies that matches right up with some other surveys done. That would mean around 10 million infected in the U.S. and an infected fatality rate of around 0.35%

Looks like it, need more studies of course.

And to add, you have to catch a virus in order to die from it. This may not be as widespread or may be more widespread than the flu of course affecting the overall death count.

Worth mentioning that Santa Clara County is both wealthier and healthier than most of the US, and that the healthcare system there hasn't been overwhelmed because of social distancing measures taken, which went into effect much earlier than for most of the US. Good news for sure, but don't want anyone to take this as "this virus isn't a big deal".

An update from Estonia. While globally we've passed the 2 million confirmed cases as well as 100 k deaths mark, in the big picture the outbreak seems to be stabilizing. So people are yearning to get to back to normal, since some countries are already relieving restrictions. Looks like things won't change much here in Estonia in May and June, at least that's the latest word from the government. So it seems the state of emergency will be extended? At the moment it should last until the 1st of May. A drop in hospitalized patients is an encouraging sign, but coming down from this horrible peak will take time. And people are getting impatient, which is I guess why conspiracy theories are running rampant. Like the whole 5G and Bill Gates thing.

Anyone else seeing businesses already shutting down? I‚Äôve already seen 3 in my area whose signs have been removed. 2 restaurants and 1 retail shop in a shopping center that just opened about 4 months ago. In the One shopping area it‚Äôs one of those a walk around places with the movie theater and everything I heard that the tenants went to the landlord as a group which is a large company with shopping centers all over the United States and said listen we need a break on our rent we haven‚Äôt been open and even when we open we‚Äôre still not going to get Business and basically the company said pay up or leave so one of the retail shops shut down.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation updated their forecast model as of 04/17.

Forecasted Total US Deaths went down from 68k to 60k by August. Social distancing is working better than forecasted for rural states. Northeast states had their totals increased, as deaths are not dropping as quickly as expected from peak.

Viruses are the smallest replicating biological entity. We can only "see" them through scanning electron microscopes. At that scale, color doesn't really have a meaning. The colors that various renderings use are speculative, and not intended to represent nature.

I understand that it is partially due to how they define Covid deaths, Belgium included nursing home deaths from the start and most other countries only counted hospital deaths, it is not clear yet whether they are actually much worse off or just reported more comprehensively.

Why hasn't New York reported new cases today? Also Washington didn't report yesterday or today. Anyone know the numbers?

Not sure if this has been posted, if so, I apologize.

How does this model the news talks about of 61k deaths by 8/4/20 make any sense at all? People keep touting it as some kind of proof social distancing worked.

I'm no mathematician but it's only 4/17 and we're at 37k dead. It seems like unless the death rate just falls off a cliff we're going to far surpass 61k by the end of May.

Am I missing something?

EDIT: I did the math. There is 109 days between today and 8/4/20. We would have to average 211 deaths a day to hit the 61k target. I understand models aren't balls on accurate but it doesn't really even seem like we're going to be in the same zip code when all is said and done.

NY has been retroactively adding deaths because people have been dying in homes. If they were probably COVID patients and died in March, NY has been adding them. That's why there was like 6K+ deaths the other day.

At this point the summer is still dicey itself. Also the weather is too flighty. I live in Canada now, and it's snowing. I lived in Texas before this, and some summer days got so unbearably hot you began to sweat the moment you stepped outside - it was brutal. The entire pool would heat up like a hot tub I remember! And that's not even Arizona levels...

I don't know what they will end up doing with schools but I know many states have already said they are online only until fall (at least).

Im really really really hoping that Remdesivir trials have good results and the drug gets approved next month as a treatment. One guy in his 50s who was hospitalized in chicago and put on oxygen was given the drug and after the first day, his fever went away and he was weaned off oxygen and 2 days later he was discharged. The first covid 19 patient in the US recieved the drug as well with optimal results. We dont have enough data yet to warrant approval but I really really hope it works.

You know what's gonna happen. They'll roll out antibody tests for everybody. And these idiots will already have had covid, and they'll get their official green cards and go back to work. And as punishment for following instructions and staying in our homes, we'll have to stay there, still uninfected, while these guys work and play however they want.

I'm curious to see how the governors respond to guiding their states through the phases. I know there are many good capable governors, but I also feel many were put in their positions that are not fit to do much of anything. This is the first time I remember were the states are in charge of how they react to a national emergency. I loved how many govs said its not a one size fits all and states should be in charge of reopening. Trump said ok, now I feel some are going oh sh√ót, I'm going to have to take responsibility instead of playing the blame game. I hope every state has competent leadership but can see many swimming and some sinking.

I live with my parents, husband, and son due to economic reasons.

Im so stressed at home because my family (excluding my husband) is trying to debunk it and say it's some conspiracy. My dad is extremely conservative and believes this isn't a thing. My mom, to say the very least, is on a different planet, talking about 5g and how it's related to COVID-19.

On top of that, my husband's paramedic schooling was basically made online. And he's stuck in a room trying to teach himself everything he needs to know during this time.

My son is a toddler. (that should say enough.)

Im so burnt and tired and stressed out. I haven't been out except to the store here and there (like once every 2 weeks?) in 2 months.

It makes me sick that so many people are ignoring the social distancing recommendations. It's only making the country worse off and making the people who are following the rules (and going insane) wait longer to just go back to normal.

These aren't results. It's partial information coming from a trail, it'll be interesting to see what is actually published. From the New York Times.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said "the totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial."

UChicago Medicine, also in an email, said "partial data from an ongoing clinical trial is by definition incomplete and should never be used to draw conclusions."

I hope it's as good as being reported. But this isn't ant different than people getting excited about hydroxcholrquine earlier. It could easily go the other way still.

Shouting off into the void here, but truth be told I think I am starting to crack because of this lockdown. What‚Äôs getting to me is not so much the lack of social contact, I‚Äôve always been highly introverted, but the claustrophobia. I know I can go outside, in fact I run between 6-8 miles every other day, with a 10 plus mile long run on the weekends as a critical part of keeping myself sane at the best of times. Even with that I feel like the walls are starting to close in, and I am losing my mind. I‚Äôll admit between the ADHD and absurdly high levels of anxiety which the outbreak has made worse, just sitting still and binging on Netflix or video games is not in my constitution, and since the start of the outbreak, I feel like a tightly coiled spring hat‚Äôs about to burst. I cannot focus on any of my hobbies and I feel like I am bouncing off the walls. The only escapes I have are my runs, and my drive to and from work (yay for being essential personnel in a datacenter.

To make matters worse my best friend Chai, a twelve and a half year old Belgian Malinois mix, has just been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. While the prognosis is good, she‚Äôs got eighteen to twenty four months at this point the end is coming. My fear is, she tales a sudden turn for the worse, the end will come a lot sooner than that. I am afraid that if that happens, because of Covid-19 restrictions I will not be able to be with Chai, who‚Äôs been my shadow since she was three months old, and she will go to the bridge surrounded by strangers, and not her family.

I‚Äôll keep on but this is taking a very serious toll.

Sorry to hear that, I've been bouncing off the walls too. I can't go on my hike since all the trails in LA are closed, so I've just been in my apartment for weeks, undereating to not gain weight, and watching old forumla 1 races. I broke up with a girl I was seeing right before the lockdowns happened so I was very sad and lonely for the beginning of the lockdown but I got into a rhythm of being by myself that became tolerable. I envy the runs, I thought about running but there's tons of bums on my street corner. I'm sorry to hear about your pet too, my dogs died in 2010 and 2016 and while I miss them I'm glad I didn't have to lose them now where going to the vet is a big decision. Keep up the good work bud, this sucks, I'm surprised more people aren't losing it.

My entire friend group is planning to join a protest in a few days against the current stay at home order in my state. It's picking up absolutely insane traction. I'm basically in the minority in not going.

I think a large chunk of the US is just done bothering with this now. We are going the Sweden route. Hope it doesn't go badly for us. People need their restaurants and football I guess.

That is an issue that people don't see with stay at home orders.

They are great when people buy into it, but as time goes on, less and less people are willing to buy into it. Especially if they are looking at economic hardship the longer this goes on.

My suggestion is if you want to stay friends with them, don't push what you think as completely right and suggest that they are dumb for doing what they are doing. There are 2 sides to every argument, and the goal of debating is to come to better understanding of what other people think.

Do this NOW, not tomorrow, not later:

take a pen and paper and make a daily schedule. One for today, one for tomorrow.

Start meditating and put it on your above list. Get a free meditating app or search youtube on how to do it. 15 minutes everyday, no excuses.

Exercise 2 times a day. Put it on your list. Doesnt have to be much, just enough to get your heart pumping and endorphins going.

Take a daily walk or two. Put it on your list. Walk alone, stay away from people, look at the trees, the leaves, the gravel, whatever. Your mind will wander, bring it back to the things around you.

Limit your covid19 news intake. After 6 PM no more covid news or talking about it. Put it on your list.

Limit social media. After 6 pm no more fb, insta or whatever. Put it on your list.

Make sure you have fun moments. It's hard, but try to find them. Watch an 3pisode of your favorite comedy, or browse some funny subs (no news).

Drink chamomile tea, lots of it. It reduced inflamation across all body including the brain, which gives you a state of well-being. Put it on your list.

Again, do it NOW, and dont expect instant results. But you will notice that with each item crossed off the list, you will feel slightly better.

Anybody else find it a bit weird when all these world leaders and politicians keep saying ‚Äúwe will win this war against coronavirus‚Äù. Being very honest, it looks like majority of countries have already lost it- especially the USA. Just look at the death tolls some countries have racked up, I remember everyone here in England being shocked at the daily figures in Italy and we quickly surpassed those. 14.5K deaths in UK (and rising) is hardly my idea of ‚Äúwinning a war‚Äù.

These governments need to be held accountable for their failures and short comings. They knew the trends that were being shown in countries and failed to act quickly enough. The situation in UK regarding PPE is nothing short of shambolic. The government again need to be help accountable.

Once this is all done, I sincerely hope all these doctors and nurses are given the respect they deserve. Some patients treat them like absolute dirt, hopefully that will change.

if the government is truly grateful they could give them a pay rise, rather than the farce of clapping for them (ironically in big groups of people )

The coronavirus and lockdown remind me of a real world problem that has been happening before this.

There are two police officers in a town. One hides at a redlight intersection all day, and every day he catches at least two people running a red light and gives them a ticket. The second officer always keeps his car in plain sight at the stoplight for all to see. Every day at least two people think about running a red light but choose not to so they don't get a ticket. The first police officer is not preventing any risk of accidents while the second police officer removes all risk of accidents. At the end of the year, the police station promotes the first police officer for successfully catching over 700 violations while the second police officer is fired for not catching a single person all year.

It's difficult to calculate events that don't happen. The 2nd police officer can't come home and say "I stopped two people from running red lights." because they don't know that. The same thing is happening with the shutdown. People are saying "This shutdown over 60,000 deaths is not worth it. That's how many die from the flu but we don't shut down over that." Just like Trump said at the presser today, if we did nothing then a minimum of 1.6-2 million Americans would have died. If we could view a parallel world where no steps were taken then people could see that and realize we are taking the right steps. But since it is so hard to calculate events that didn't happen, the success of the lockdown is working against itself. Just like the success of our police officer got him fired.

We insisted on developing our own tests and got started too late. PPE stockpile was only ever filled once and then forgotten about and the pandemic response team was dismantled. Furthermore when news of the virus came out a lot of individual people stocked up on consumer PPE. Furthermore a small handful of people bought up tens of thousands of masks and bottles of sanitizer in an effort to price-gouge and make a profit. Also, we probably don't actually manufacture very much PPE, so we are reliant on larger supply chains to generate new PPE.

I‚Äôll just rant here to get it out somewhere and drain the pus of the mind.

I had to reapply for unemployment insurance because it seems after a month of not getting it your claim automatically expires. I‚Äôve been avoiding calling them because I didn‚Äôt want to tie up the lines for people who needed it more but if I had known that my claim is reset and I go to the back of the line again I‚Äôd have been calling every day. I guess I was naively hoping being patient was the right move but now I suspect I‚Äôll never see anything from those 4 weeks I was meant to be receiving benefits.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, really. I‚Äôve called the DES a dozen times to get the same recording of how busy they are and I‚Äôm frustrated and sad that so many people are in the same boat as me. And to be frank the money I‚Äôm chasing is a huge cut from what my work was- I feel demeaned to jump thru hoops for a pittance when the ultrarich corporations were bailed out automatically. Designer face masks and private jets so they can continue living in their bubbles and mansions.

Mansions. I‚Äôd be happy with a ten more feet in my apartment. I hate my tiny apartment and the useless kitchenette and was looking to move before this and now I feel trapped in it more than ever. All I can do to keep on an even keel is to bike and draw. I‚Äôve lost all semblance of a normal sleep schedule. I can‚Äôt stand all this cutesy Reddit posts of couples calling each other coworkers- I‚Äôm getting too bitter without a social outlet.

went to dentist today for emergency- none of the office staff or assistants were wearing masks. i checked in and filled out all paperwork online before walking in the door as i was told but still had to stand at the desk speaking with the receptionist for 5 minutes. then when i got taken back i had to sign some papers and the lady was over my shoulder explaining everything and didnt have a mask or gloves or anything. the only person that had a mask was the dentist and the lady that did my xray. there was also a lady in the waiting room coughing like crazy. i went to the best and most well respected practice in my city and was shocked when i walked in to see no one at the desk wearing masks. i didnt wear a mask because you know, i was about to lay there with my mouth open getting operated on and i figured they would have every precaution in place. but yeah now i cant stop freaking out thinking i am going to get sick because of this üò≠ i havent left the house since march 17th until today. ive done everything i can and now i have a greater risk that i have been exposed. ugh i just needed to vent :(

The media is sure talking about the decline of testing. Why are we testing fewer people the further along this virus progresses, beginning of April 100k daily testing, now to the middle of April were down to 75k.

On further review of the ACLA data the only represent two-thirds of the testing apparatus in the country

Hard to make a comparison saying cases are down when you're testing fewer people. Unless that's the narrative you want to drive to the population.

A good friend of mine in America is giving up their job at a grocery store to become unemployed because he doesn't want to risk his life stacking shelves for minimum wage. I don't envy him, but I do respect his decision. America seems to be hit really bad with the virus and it's not even really fully spread there yet and so many Americans are still ignorant to how dangerous it is.

From someone who has battled and continues to battle my own mental health issues reading about suicides across the world has broken my heart. I too have suffered with severe anxiety since early 2018. This led to me becoming isolated from everyday life and from the people around me. This anxiety slowly led to severe self-loathing, something that still affects me to this day. Depression kicked in as i fell ill in February of 2018, leaving me bed bound for 3 months and me gaining 30kg from the heavy medication i was taking. Since then however, my mental state has improved drastically and my mind is clearer than it has ever been. Opening up was the key to this and i will be forever grateful to the person i first opened up to for accepting me with such love and not judging my actions.

I've started a petition to help raise awareness for people suffering with mental health issues throughout this lockdown period.

In the petition I've also mentioned the creation of a platform on Twitter and Instagram for people that may need to open up and have a chat about their problems.

I would greatly appreciate if you could share or even just sign the petition below and follow the account @lockdownpal on Twitter and Instagram to help me spread the word.

Stay Safe Stay Home Stay Strong ‚ù£Ô∏è

If you're interested in helping me spread the word, comment or message me and that would be great, if not that's absolutely fine ü§ó

[Home-Made Mask](http://Sewing your own mask is easy, says Jeannette Childers, who‚Äôs 77 and lives in Mesa, Arizona. She‚Äôs among scores of volunteers across the country sewing masks. So far, she‚Äôs made 65.

Materials you need to make a cloth face mask

How to download a face mask pattern

PDF of adult mask pattern

Note: Make sure your printer is set up to print at "actual size." 

Cut material and interfacing to 12 x 9 inches

Iron interfacing to material (adhesive side to back of material)

Once ironed, fold fabric in half with interfacing on the outside

Cut two pieces of elastic ‚Äî each 7-inches long

Click to show more

5. Pin and sew 1/4-inch from edge leaving a 2-inch gap in the center

6. Put elastic band on each corner, inside the material and pin to keep in place, making sure the elastic is not twisted. Pinning in center as well

7. Using the pattern, mark locations of pleat lines and add pins on both sides

8. Fold 3 pleats. Sew around the entire perimeter of the mask, this holds the pleats in place, and closes the 2-inch gap

All you have to do is remove the pins, test out your new mask and head out to do your grocery shopping or wherever might make social distancing difficult. 

While you‚Äôre at it, make extra to donate. The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers.

Angelica Jaramillo Harding, a nurse in Mesa, Arizona, picks up donated masks from a Joann fabric and Craft store every Friday to distribute at hospitals, medical centers and clinics. Last week, she gave away 350 of them.

Since March 23, Joann stores nationwide have been providing supplies to make masks for free if you donate the finished products. Since then, they‚Äôve donated more than 16 million. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely touched by the community,‚Äù Harding said. ‚ÄúIt helps us not to feel alone in this.‚Äù

So I finally got the rapid test (NOT antibody) and it came back negative. Because it‚Äôs been almost a month since I was sick (that‚Äôs how long it took for Dept of Health to get back to me here in NY), the result basically means that either I did have COVID but it‚Äôs been too long and I‚Äôm not longer positive OR I never had it. Needless to say, the only thing that can solve this riddle is the antibody test. I‚Äôm dying to get one but it‚Äôll probably take another month or two.

Does anyone know if there is any consensus about immunity? I keep reading conflicting articles about it. If I indeed had the ‚ÄòRona, will I be immune to it once the lockdown is over? Or will I only be immune to the strain we had here in NY?

Ro is a measure of contagiousness, the reproductive rate. Essentially how many additional people each victim infects. An Ro of 5.9 is very high. Not Measles or Cholera high, but way more than influenza.

One component of Ro is Susceptibility. What percentage of people exposed to the virus will it be able to replicate in. For a novel virus like this one that spreads through droplets and works on contact with lung tissues all humans have and where there is not enough similarity in method to another circulating virus, almost no humans are immune. So if you breathe the droplets, you're going get the virus.

One feature that helps the virus kick our ass is this reproductive rate. If you think about it, breathing the respiratory secretions of strangers is nasty and we should probably break that fairly universal human habit if we don't want to do this again.

Another is that our social mores include working sick. Even demanding that others work when they are sick. A depraved, dehumanizing practice.

Another is a culture with inadequate respect for worker safety. Employers who demand workers work without PPE in close contact with people who could be sick for appearance sake. Can't let you wear a mask, you might scare the customers. Can't ask the customers to wear a mask or stay away if they are sick.

And of course the annual Lunar New Year diaspora led to optimal global distribution. Global rapid travel may need a restructuring. This bug had great timing. If we don't learn this lesson, another will again.

Why are our leaders acting like once things ‚Äúpeak‚Äù they will immediately get better? And have a symmetrical rise and fall of cases? Italy‚Äôs deaths peaked about 3 weeks ago and they have been steadily decreasing by like 20-30 per day. They‚Äôve been plateauing at 500-600 per day for like a week.

Statement from Gilead. People are getting ahead of their skis here

"We understand the urgent need for a Covid-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. The totality of the data need to be analysed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial." "Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19. We expect the data from our Phase 3 study in patients with severe Covid-19 infection to be available at the end of this month, and additional data from other studies to become available in May."

I have absolutely no idea what this math actually means but here you go:

According to the WHO the CFR is 3.4%. Obviously the IFR is way lower (0.6% seems to be popping up in a lot of studies), but let‚Äôs pretend the IFR is 3.4% for this.

3.4% of New York State is 661000 people.

Currently 17131 people in NYS have died, or 2.6% of 661000.

If we assume deaths aren‚Äôt a lagging indicator (they are) then we‚Äôd expect 2.6% of New York to be infected, or 505000, but only 233000 have tested positive.

Therefore, if deaths weren‚Äôt a lagging indicator and the CFR is 3.4% then New York is missing 50% of its cases. With an IFR of 0.6% and deaths naturally lagging by 14 days or so New York could easily be missing 90%+ of its cases which translates to 10%+ being infected. I think this illustrates just how inadequate testing has been.

I‚Äôm under the impression that flattening the curve still results in roughly the same number of infected cases just over a longer timeframe. If that‚Äôs the case then shouldn‚Äôt quarantine recommendations be based on healthcare resources and not the belief that avoiding the virus is possible?

If we don‚Äôt flatten the curve, we get the same number of cases, but 3 times the deaths because not enough ICU beds/ventilation available. If we flatten the curve we get the same number of cases but 1/3 the deaths because everyone who needs an icu bed/ventilator will get one.

Edit: in at least one part of the UK there is now a Do Not Revive order on anyone over 75 reguardless if their heart stops due to covid19 or not, because that hospital doesn‚Äôt have the resources now to treat everyone. UK didn‚Äôt flatten the curve enough.

The WHO is still bad news, right now at this very moment, with their continued insistence that members of public should not wear basic face masks to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Even basic face masks demonstrably capture virus laden droplets emitted from the respiratory systems of their wearers, this is why the WHO does recommend that those showing symptoms of disease and those caring for them should wear masks. The problem is that just by looking normal people are in effect showing symptoms of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to its common asymptomatic nature. It does not take a leap in genius to understand given those facts that everyone should be wearing basic masks. Duh.

Again, the WHO is definitely bad news, right now at this moment.

This right here, the virus is not particularly deadly Vs other kinds of coronavirus, it's party trick is that it causes little to no symptoms in carrier's. Everyone needs to be aware of their ability to spread it, telling everyone not to wear masks goes in completely the other direction.

I'm inactive right now due to the virus, but for the last 9 years I've been swapping postcards with people all over the world, and 5 days ago I got a postcard from China that was mailed on Nov 23rd:

https://i.imgur.com/XrEQadd.jpg

And I registered it today and it was mailed from Wuhan. Glad that got stopped for a while and I'm glad I quarantined it for a while too. Ironic is that the postcard is of an emergency food tent from the Sichuan earthquake in 2008. Little did they know on Nov 23rd what was coming.

Lol, so true.

This sub has no regard for the economy, and the long term effects on people's lives due to a bad one. Like it can literally cause deaths and maybe even a war if it gets really bad.

Not saying I don't want to save lives... but it isn't so virtuous to try and save as many lives today, at the cost of future lives. It is all about weighing pros and cons.

Call your doctor is the answer to anyone asking medical advice on Reddit. Will probably tell you to self quarantine but is still good information for your doctor to have possible cases and keep up with you and see how it is spreading if it is COVID.

Reddit is not the right place to get any kind of personal or medical advice, tbh. Mention that you had a slight argument with your wife over the ponouciation of 'GIF' last week, and most answers would probably tell you to leave her ASAP because of the 'red flag' it is.

I have 3 old N95 facemasks that were in my garage from painting projects I've done in the past. My question is if I steam them to try and sanitize them a bit, can I add fabric to them to give them some more protection since they're used? Should I hand sew the fabric to them or can I use fabric fusion on them? What's my best route? (I live in San Antonio and face masks are mandatory now so I'm making them for all my family)

I live in Montana and my family has been hunkered down. That said they are starting to feel like it is safe to resume all activities next week. And as things will be reopening that won‚Äôt be hard to do. My father is 67 and a cancer survivor and has a job where he knocks countless doors in our area. I‚Äôm trying to make sure I can gather information to inform them about why things are still pretty intense and why they should be careful (unless you feel that is not the case as well)

Knowing where we are at would help a great deal... thank you for your time guys and stay safe out there :)

How is the feeling around the world?

I¬¥m in Hamburg, Germany.

So far I believe our government has done a decent job with appropriate measures, even though in the beginning there was a lot of confusion and insecurity about the situation and thus, a delay in action. Now I think most people have arranged themselves with the measures taken.

What makes it hard to believe in the rules is our federal system with different rules in every state. It takes peoples trust in the government down to some extent. I also fear we are getting impatient. Many states want to reopen the economy and schools to different extents.

In NRW, our most populated state, the state government decided to go forward faster with reopening the schools. Pupils are protesting online against it, in fear for risk groups and relatives. I hope the state governments have a concept of protecting pupils in school, even though that is hard to believe in with underfunded schools everywhere.

I hope we can ramp up testing to go over to a test and isolate strategy in the near future. But I fear the coming reopening will make the infections go up and put a lot of stress to our health care system.

I personally have arranged myself with home office and try to do sports and other activities on my own to keep me healthy and sane.

Stay hopeful! Lots of love from Germany.

Italian hospital worker here: we had a colleague testing positive, should we be getting tested (how about the patients?)?

The dude tested positive yesterday after working 3 full shifts (8 hours each) since getting back from vacation.

We're only using surgical masks in the ward, we get one of them each per shift but the colleagues occasionally take them off while eating lunch/dinner in the small kitchen (only 3 people allowed simultaneously).

Do you think the whole staff should be getting tested at this point or at the very least those who worked alongside him?

Are there official guidelines I could quote to management should they refuse to get us tested?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Meeting with the faith leaders is honestly pretty important. Getting them on the same page and getting them to spread to their congregations what to do is a huge part of getting compliance with the reopening strategy that Trump unveiled.

They employ 1.72 million people and have sway over a pretty good portion of the population, especially in areas where compliance with social distancing is worst.

Same with meeting with the leaders of the sports leagues. They're two massive sectors with a ton of influence, their support and compliance is huge

Everyone is applauding healthcare workers, and there is lots of talk about finding a vaccine....but no one mentions the animal research and the people who dedicate their lives to taking care of these animals (that in turn, benefit us greatly.) I have a close family member who works in animal research and animal welfare. She seems frustrated because she pointed out how no one is talking about how we will need to use these animals for trials for the vaccine. Animal rights activists and anti-vaxxers can eat their words when they're getting the vaccine to get immunity in 6 months to a year. No one is applauding the people who take care of these animals (They're still going to work.) The animals still need to be fed and taken care of. We will need these animals in order to find a vaccine. These people dedicate their lives to making sure the animals are treated humanely and with compassion. I'm tired of people being anti-animal research, when in reality, we need them.

I'm a nurse, I am happy when I see people outside wearing any kind of mask. It means my unit is less likely to spike next week. Go for it, if anyone is a prick feel free to say that a nurse wanted you to wear it and want them to wear one too. Our hospital is going to re-use N95 anyways so supply is going to be less of an issue. It's true that N95 are super uncomfortable and very hard to wear correctly, but even when worn incorrectly they offer just as much protection as a surgical mask and more protection than a fabric mask. Put a used N95 in a paper bag and wait 7 days and they should be safe to worn again. Take care

You can use them outside, I've seen plenty of people with N95's on the subway and on the street.

I wouldn't care what other people think of you, you're using them to protect yourself and others. If people can walk around in full hazmat suits you can use a proper mask.

That means it‚Äôs going to be bad for awhile still. The only thing that can fix that right now is medical advancements. So far we don‚Äôt have them but that could change at any time. However lacking that I would say it‚Äôs not as bad as it can be. All depends how much the world opens back up and how many adjust to wearing masks as the new normal.

just had a look at the worldwide death total. At the start of this month we had 47,000 deaths and right now we have 154,000 deaths in just 18 days. It's scary to think what the end result of this will be worldwide

So the curve is supposedly flattened and we are past the peak, but cases on worldometer are 32k with 2500 deaths today. What gives?

If the curve hadn't flattened a bit you would be seeing 50-60K cases and 4000-5000 deaths daily by now, 100K cases and 10K deaths daily in a bit more than a week, etc.

Hate to say it, but the people in america on average are too stupid. Russia won. For years they have been trying to pit ideologies against each other by coordinating fake events at the same locations for people of conflicting interests. Look up the "Donk Contest" in Austin in 2018 for one small example.

This virus and lock down gives them a perfect opportunity, the conflicting ideologies are people v the government issuing shut down orders. On top of that, just getting people out to protest will increase the risk of the current pandemic spreading.

Was it really as easy as setting up stupid protest the lockdown facebook pages in a time of crisis? Americans, on average, are very f***ing stupid.

The dumbing down of America has been truly sad to see. As an American that loves this country, I can't help but feel we've passed the point of return where it's possible for people to reconcile and talk about stuff.

I used to think a major tragedy would cause people to unite and look past their stupid political divisions, and realize that the vast majority of people may disagree in some areas, but don't come from a place of hatred, or a place of wanting to hurt others.

instead people have just become further entrenched in their stupid political divides. The amount of false information and news that is just being shared everyday, is truly staggering. The amount of hatred people seem to have for people that disagree with them politically over how to handle this virus is depressing.

Did anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 have gastrointestinal issues? I've been having diarrhea for the past few days, and want to know if it's a stomach bug or corona. I know there's no way to for sure tell without testing, but I'm a bit scared and my anxiety isn't helping with any of it.

From the little I know, intestinal issues were present in a lower percentage of cases. Fatigue, fever and dry cough are usually the more common, but try to get tested if possible.

I noticed that the IHME projection was revised down again from 68,000 total deaths to 60,000. However, before the revision the death totals were already on the higher side of their projections for the past few days. Also, their model supposedly assumes full social distancing through May which we now know won't happen with Texas announcing today they will begin lifting restrictions in April and May. Anyone have insights into their model adjustments? The UT model revised up their estimates and is predicting about double the fatalities as IHME.

To start, it's nearly impossible for the vulnerable (or anyone) to have absolutely no contact with anyone. So if the less vulnerable are living their normal lives, and the vulnerable population needs groceries or doctors appointments, then their risk of coming in contact with someone who has contracted the virus goes up exponentially. Whereas if everyone just stays home and continues to social distance, the risk of anyone (vulnerable population included) contracting or spreading the virus goes down.

Stomach is sore, aches are starting, I've barely eaten in the last two days. I've had a dry cough and itchy eyes for a week now, figured it was allergies. The bottom of my chest hurts and I went from breathing fine to a mild wheeze in the last few hours.

I've been telling myself it's psychosomatic. I've got a Dr appointment in the morning. I can't sleep.

My county is about to hit 5000 cases, 300 deaths. One friend's 26 year old brother is coming out of the hospital this week from this. Other friend's whole family, including her parents with COPD, ran through it pretty painlessly within a week. Her parents only had it a day. She's still coughing (27 no other health issues). Makes no sense to me who gets hit the worst.

Here's hoping it's all in my head.

One of the first antibody studies just released.

If my layman's brain understands it correctly, for every confirmed case of covid-19, there are 50-85 people with antibodies.

Doesn't this increase the denominator exponentially? And, if so, doesn't it put covid-19 smack in the middle of seasonal flu territory (and if more on the 85 side, it means that it is a mild example of the seasonal flu)?

Even if this were true on a rate basis. Being that we have 0 immunity, the numbers will still be significant. The us is on pace to have 50k deaths in April alone. And that‚Äôs with a 2 week lockdown in March leading into April which has continued through April. 50k deaths a month is an entire year of the flu in the US. So even if technically the same rate, the rate of infected is also significantly larger, which makes the death total, ultimately, significantly larger.

Imagine if we had no distancing or lockdown. We‚Äôre gonna have 50k deaths with a lockdown. It might be double or even more than that without one.

I follow an old coworker on Instagram who post daily of his going out in groups, picnics at the park, drinking & smoking weed with a bunch of other mid 20yr olds. He recently posted to his IG story of him going to one of those drive thru testing sites with one of his friends. Then he goes back to hanging out with different people everyday!

No. But now I think about it, it‚Äôs a fairly good idea. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôd do if you had an elevated tempreture without other symptoms, apart from quarantine yourself more aggressively.

I‚Äôm in the ‚Äòeveryone should be wearing bandanas or scarves over their nose and mouth when you leave the house - save the medical masks for the health professionals‚Äô camp. But if you aren‚Äôt wearing a face covering when not at home, then you definitely should if you spike a tempreture.

First of all, assuming all those people got health insurance from their jobs is laughable. Second, 2% is a really high mortality rate. We don‚Äôt have any other bugs that are this widespread and that deadly in our lifetimes. To put that in perspective, if 2% is the mortality rate, it‚Äôs about 100 times as deadly as the flu, which is already deadly.

They said 2% and asked for a direct response so I went with that.

The power the fatality rate, the better.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I know about a dozen people at this point who have had it. One is recently in remission from cancer and she did need to be treated at the hospital, but she was released the same day and recovered. Everyone else is recovering from home or already recovered. Two are in their 60s, one of those people is obese. Three kids had it and had extremely mild symptoms. I know we see all these sensationalized stories about how it‚Äôs killing ‚Äúperfectly healthy young people.‚Äù Yeah, that happens. My cousin died from swine flu at 28 and that has a significantly lower mortality rate. It happens. We can‚Äôt focus on the individual stories, we need to focus on the trends. Right now, to me, that means we need to figure out how to manage the virus in nursing homes. What is happening there is unbelievably tragic. Most of us can minimize our risks and even if we get it, our chances are pretty good.

The counter argument is unemployment insurance is getting paid out, and staying home can allow thousands to live who otherwise will die from this thing. And an overrun of the hospitals would guarantee people would die of other things. On top of that it remains unclear who or how many will have long term negative effects of contracting this virus. There is evidence for heart and kidney damage in addition to lung damage.

The federal govt, if we had a functioning one, should be able to provide financial support to people through this. But that‚Äôs assuming there is a modicum of competence in the executive branch, which doesn‚Äôt look like the situation.

That's the fault of the population for electing politicians that don't give a flying f*** about you the citizens.

For decades many of the population have been apolitical, not willing to reinforce their rights, not willing to vote with their conscience, or worse of all not even vote.

if you're not willing to perform even a basic amount of civic duty. Then you cannot be angry when your political process gets away from you.

Those people will be permanently out of a job and health insurance when they get fired for asking for time off so they can recover from illness or care for their sick children, because their employer still doesn't provide sick time and their employer is exempted from FFCRA (or fired anyway because their employer cares more about money than their health and can replace them easily while rolling the dice on the low probability of them suing). If they choose to work sick instead of getting fired, well, you know how that goes...

Since Wuhan lock down is over, they are now actively asking people to report deaths due to ‚Äúprobable‚Äù covid infection but never had a lab test. Those cases were not counted as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases because lack of lab testing initially.

Other places are doing the same thing, for example, NY state where I live started counting probable cases.

In any endemic including the flu, the ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases are always lower than actual cases because not everyone gets tested to confirm they have the disease. Unless the country is able to test everybody like Iceland. But we know in China, Italy, USA and many countries, there weren‚Äôt enough test kits so only severe cases were tested. Thus, their ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases would not include mild and asymptomatic cases, and deaths of untested patients.

I hope this serves as a basic epidemiology tip. Comparing the death/case number between countries actually don‚Äôt mean much. The testing method and reporting method are different.

If NY opens depending on where you are in the state and you aren't in NYC or close to it, you may have a summer.

If you're in NYC or if NY does what they always do and decides that what happens in NYC applies to everyone because NY has always does that? Your summer will suck

Just a general annoyance I have: almost every model seems to assume spread, death, hospital capacity and basically every other epidemiological stat follows a normal, symmetric, parabolic distribution. To me this is just extremely inaccurate, the decline will be far flatter than the initial rise and therefore the curve won‚Äôt be symmetrical.

Newest IHME has slightly fixed the error you identify. Originally they did match rise to fall which is unreasonable. They have slowed the drop in the latest update.

To me it seems like in the United States we have addressed the economic issue terribly. Why are frontline workers not getting hazard pay while we‚Äôre paying people to stay home that would rather be at work. The allocation of resources just seems moronic. Instead of dishing out an arbitrary amount of money and funding unemployment to the point where you make more money for being out of work, why not directly fund employers and have payroll protection for all.

Hear me out, if there are people that are protesting to go back to work, isn‚Äôt it their right to risk their lives for the betterment of the economy and their financial well-being. Why not pass laws to protect all vulnerable citizens, including those in the workforce, while letting those willing to work go to work.

I feel like the federal gov‚Äôt should fund employers:

1.) to cover expenses for non-essential businesses and to pay a fraction of salary to non-essential employees laid-off temporarily due to the virus. 2.) to pay a fraction of salary for workers too afraid, or at-risk to return to work at essential businesses. 3.) to increase wages for those working frontline jobs (grocery store workers, truck drivers, package handlers).

I feel like this scenario, with a more minor boost to unemployment insurance would make sense. Why is the low-skilled restaurant worker getting $800 a week on unemployment while our nurses are risking their lives and grocery store workers are still being paid minimum wage? Also, why are we sending stimulus to people who would rather just be at their jobs, why not send that money to small businesses that have employees that CAN‚ÄôT return to work?

Just seems like I‚Äôve talked to many people that are confused why they are getting a check, while there are others that still can‚Äôt afford food and will owe three months rent by the end of June...

The answer basically boils down to: They had to do something quick, so they dumped a ton of money and used super broad strokes to decide who gets it and who doesn't. Some people got an extra $1,200, some people got screwed. If this drags on for longer then you can probably expect to see more nuanced financing.

I read that the loss of smell and taste were associated with people who had less severe symptoms. So that would suggest that the likelihood of permanent loss would be remote. However, if it's affecting taste and smell, it seems it's attacking the central nervous system in some way, so that's a bit scary.

Question from the UK.

My dad works in construction and has been asked to go back to work next week.

The problem is the job they are going to is 3 hours away and so the group of people he works with will all need to stay over.

There is already a problem with transport as not all of the lads drive, so there will be at least 3 people per van.

The boss has also booked them a house to stay at, where they all will have their own en-suite rooms (so he says) but the living area and kitchen will be shared.

I don't think this is right.

I've searched high and low online for what the rules are for people who are required to work away from home for periods of time, to then return home again. Does anyone have any idea about what the guidence is around this?

The boss has said if he refuses to go he will only get sick pay as the furlough rules only apply when there is no work, not to people who don't feel safe going even if the whole team don't want to go.

NOTE: France reported that a portion of the EHPAD and EMS nursing home cases - representing about 33% of the total EHPAD and EMS cases - were confirmed (rather than probable, as the other 67%) and as such are to be considered as already included in the total national case count [source]. The French Government has now started reporting the breakdown between confirmed and probable EHPAD and EMS cases [source]. We have adjusted the historical data for France from April 4 based on this information. In accordance with the decision by the French Government to include EHPAD and EMS probable deaths in the total death count [source] [source] EHPAD and EMS probable cases must be included in the total case count in order to be logically sound (a death implies a case) and methodologically consistent. On April 3, the French Government had reported 17,827 additional cases and 532 additional deaths from nursing homes that had not been reported previously. On April 2, it had reported 884 additional deaths.

I have family members visiting from another country stranded in NYC because their country closed their borders with no idea when they will reopen. They want to stay at my place, but I live with a parent who is in their upper 70s and considered high risk so I want to limit all outside traffic as much as possible. I feel horrible for not wanting them here and helping out but it would be both a space issue and a financial strain. How can I explain this delicately to them and what other ways can I offer assistance to them without having to have us all cooped up in a tiny NYC apartment and risking infection?

What does everyone think about countries NOT reporting on new recoveries like in the UK?

The apparent reasoning is that people will start flouting lockdown if active cases are shown to be falling. Then how come Italy, Spain and other countries that have been harder hit than the UK are reporting daily recoveries alongside new cases and deaths?

And there are millions of people in the UK (myself included) who have no intentions of breaking lockdown and would be interested in seeing the active case numbers. I know there are unofficial estimates, but these are exactly that. Unofficial and unreliable. Nobody outside the government is sure of how many active cases there are.

I think the recovery numbers are just there to help people feel better. Where I live they are doing it but have been clear that it is not at all a priority for them because it requires 2 more tests and they have better use for tests at the moment.

It seems that people that died at home, and medics did not log the deaths until later.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/17/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-death-toll-intl-hnk/index.html

Officials explained that the deaths had initially gone uncounted because in the early stages of the pandemic some people died at home, overwhelmed medics were focused on treating cases rather than reporting deaths and due to a delay in collecting figures from various government and private organizations.

They added that the figures had been revised to show "accountability to history, to the people and the victims," as well as to ensure "open and transparent disclosure of information and data accuracy."

Just medical professionals alone need at least 10x the masks being produced per month, and production is already hugely increased. There's a shortage of raw materials and major supply chain problems.

I think something as insane as a second-hand market for N95s is more likely within the next six months that pre-pandemic pricing and general availability to the general public.

Active cases are the more relevant metric when reopening. There are over 600,000 known active cases. If we reopen with that many people who can spread it, it'll be a much greater disaster.

For active cases you need confirmed testing. Guess what.... Active cases is not a realistic number at this time nor anywhere near accurate for that purpose as there can be active infections that aren't tested or confirmed. Hospitalisations is the next best thing. Not good.but atleast it's accurate enough.

Does viral load upon infection affect the severity of the illness?

My girlfriend (24) and I (28) have been self-isolating for the past month in a tiny 1 room studio apartment, the only other room is a small bathroom with no real door.

She has recently come down with a sore throat, and while it may or may not be coronavirus, I was wondering if there was any correlation between the initial viral load upon infection and severity of symptoms.

If a couple have been in the same room 24/7, would one partner being asymptomatic, while still being contagious give off a higher viral load/inoculum and cause more of a severe illness in the other partner?

We both have nowhere to go or self isolate from eachother, so I'm wondering what sort of precautions we should take if one of us were to get sick.

Also, if we're both sick, is it still good to stay away from eachother as much as possible?

In an ideal world, with mass testing, if you have 0 new positives for 14 days in a row, you could say pandemic is "over". If you mean "a controlled pandemic" is usually when you have more recovery cases than new infected, meaning the speed of recoveries is bigger than the virus spreading velocity.

I know Sweden‚Äôs strategy isn‚Äôt very popular here, but let me offer a slightly different perspective.

I think Sweden‚Äôs method is superior, and we should transition towards it once numbers stabilize a bit. A method is only effective if it is sustainable until we can develop a vaccine or gain HI. Extreme lockdowns are effective, yes, but they‚Äôre not sustainable for a virus that can never be fully eradicated. It‚Äôs tragic that Sweden has more deaths than the other Scandinavian countries now, but sooner or later the other countries are gong to have to ease their restrictions. On the other hand, Sweden will be able to sustain their current measures for an extremely long time, and this could very well pay major dividends in terms of fatality rates in a few months. This is a marathon, not a sprint, but the lockdown countries are sprinting.

Herd immunity. They just would have to open back up and whoever dies, they die, unfortunately.

Herd immunity.

But there‚Äôs no reason to believe a vaccine will be impossible. We already know what part of the virus is recognized by the immune system, it‚Äôs been cloned and demonstrated to bind antibodies of convalescent patients, and there are many ways to deliver that protein to people. Some of those methods would work slightly better than others, but several of them are already in clinical trials. Then you take the patient‚Äôs blood, demonstrate s/he has immunity, and hopefully that immunity lasts a while.

I think the fact that they were so close to a vaccine to SARS, which is quite similar to COVID, has them guessing 18 months not because it'll take that long to develop one, but because that's how long they think the regulatory processes will take (if governments make them go through the regular procedures).

That oxford scientist who keeps saying September, I think that's likely because she already did most of the grunt work on the SARS one, and what she did there just needed a little tweaking for COVID.

She's not betting for a miracle in development, she thinks that they'll be desperate enough to just approve it in September rather than going through all the procedures

We have made coronavirus vaccines before, it's just that it's for dogs and not humans, but at least we know it's possible. I'm a nurse not a researcher but I feel like if it had been super difficult then we wouldn't have done all those work to prevent diarrhea in dogs. So it probably was not the hardest vaccine we ever had to create.

There is only a few other viruses that we have yet to make vaccines for, and they all have valid reasons attached to the problem (for example, common cold has too many strains, and HIV is too immuo-specific) and none of those reasons apply to COVID as far as we can tell. We don' know for sure, but it is likely that we can do it.

It's a decision all countries will make and yours to will trade death for economics. We all make decisions everyday like this. Do I spend 100k on a safer car for my family? No I make a decision on how much risk I'm willing to take vs the cost of mitigating that risk and I compromise. Where that line of acceptable risk is, is different for everyone but we all make those decisions.

Early vaccines are probably not going to be the most effective vaccines, but if it passes clinical trials it would be better than nothing. I think we will end up with a bunch of competing vaccines, some will be better for the general population but is too dangerous for the immunocompromised, some will have more protective effects but require more frequent boosters, etc. Given the rush it is unlikely that the first vaccine to get approved is going to be the ideal one for most people. But we will take anything at this point and find an appropriate population to use it.

With how bad things are right now, if it‚Äôs something optimistic, I‚Äôll put my faith behind it. They know more than I do and if they feel confident they‚Äôll have the knockout punch ready in September, then I feel hopeful

My city is just starting. We had 0 new cases on the start of the week to 80+ and counting today. They just decided to declare that all the people on that certain part of the city as infected. Rumor around here says a PUM didn't wait for his results and decided to have a drinking session with his friends on their area. Crazy how this thing spreads so fast. https://sugbo.ph/2020/cebu-city-161-cases-april-17/?fbclid=IwAR2RYs9c-aNDLGdLx7mcREgHAAil8G30UcLldrNZ9snfbnWmk9gaxPfT9Gs

I live in michigan and have been dealing with a lot of polarizing people. In my household and online circles. Over the protests. From a legal standpoint. Is the governor breaking the constitution in her restrictions? And does she have that power with whatever emergency laws are in place. Im FOR the govenor personally but i rather know if the arguments of the protestors are legally flawed. It sure has blown up over here with polarized politics.

It's likely none these restrictions are constitutional. But, when people are scared, these concerns fly out the window.

I dont think there'll be a vaccine available and ready for distribution until 2021 at the earliest.

Have to do trials, testing, peer group analysis, all sorts of stuff, then mass production. It's a totally new virus no ones ever seen before so it's all from scratch.

Timeline is more like 18 months than 8, at best.

Kinda, but not really. COVID is a novel virus, but very similar in structure to SARS. There has been work on a SARS vaccine for a while, so while it is new, they're not starting from scratch because what they learned from battling SARS still works here.

Its the trials that take a while, but whatever the first vaccine we get is, it is highly unlikely to have gone through all of the usual requirements. Honestly, the first vaccine on the market may just be approved to buy the vaccines from the bigger companies' time to go through all the long term testing and such you want.

When there is a crisis, never doubt the procedural safeguards people will toss away to at the least contain the crisis

Some Good News on Testing in the US!

I think we finally have a positive indicator on testing in the US! Based on numbers from the COVID Tracking Project, the percent of COVID-19 tests that have a positive result looks like it might finally be trending downward! Since Monday, the percent of new tests each day that are positive has been a smaller number than the total overall percentage of tests that are positive. I see this as an indication we are FINALLY beginning to get on top of things when it comes to testing.

Now the margin is still super small (less than one percentage point smaller on all but one day), but it‚Äôs the only time we have had a multi-day trend like this even as testing massively expanded from a less than 1,000 tests a day in early March to a pretty steady mid-100,000s tests a day since the last week of March.

Sadly, we still have a long way to go though before we are actually on top of testing. Right now just under 20% of tests come back positive. Which is a huge number and suggests we are only testing people with a very high odds of having COVID-19. But progress has to start somewhere and this hopefully is an inflection point.

This also does not mean the number of infected people is going down. It probably reflects a loosening standard for when testing takes place. But that is still a good thing. It suggests we are finally at the point where our testing capacity is meeting demand and can allow for broader testing, which is sorely needed.

for instance Houston started testing anybody this week for the first time, rather than only people who proved symptoms or exposure.

depends on your state. For Cali and NY it's a no-go. But Montana or Alaska? definitely in the cards, but they'll probably limit stadiums to half capacity and request ppl spread out picnic blankets more than 6 feet from others at parks & fair grounds.

I‚Äôm obviously not a public health expert but I‚Äôm curious what people think of a reopening timeline like this:

May: Allow non-essential workers you go into work if necessary for continued operations. Reopen construction and resource extraction if it has been closed.

June: Restaurants with extremely strict sanitation and capacity requirements. Bars can open if they are sit down only.

June/July: Gyms with extremely strict capacity and sanitation requirements.

August/September: Schools and colleges.

Whenever it is safe: large gatherings (which probably includes nightclubs).

Edit: Minor clarification to point 5.

It‚Äôll be peaks and valleys until a vaccine is released. Things will open, people will be groups, and it‚Äôll spread again. Then another lockdown. Rinse, repeat. Unless people are being smart and still practicing social distancing even with things opening back up...

Somebody told me this year's flu vaccine was only 45% effective. Is it possible that COVID-19 is less deadly than thought, but some bad flu cases are being misclassified as COVID-19 cases? Especially given there's now -- in the absence of testing -- a widespread practice of treating those with COVID-19 symptoms as assumed COVID-19 patients? Thoughts?

Can't speak for everywhere, but our hospital, (and I'd presume this is for the entire corp but can't say for certain,) they test for influenza A and B before even initiating the SARS COV 2 test. At least in our ministry, there is no one being misclassified based on that. And we've had someone test positive for coronavirus and enterovirus but still be negative for SARS COV 2.

My point being, we're being very thorough. Granted, I have no clue what the rest of the world is doing.

a widespread practice of treating those with COVID-19 symptoms as assumed COVID-19 patients?

We have a presumed positive ward where the potentials are that need medical assistance that don't require an ICU bed. They aren't counted as COVID 19 unless they test positive. It creates its own logistical nightmare, but there's not really a better way to do it.

Also:

COVID-19 is less deadly than thought but some bad flu cases...

COVID 19 is the disease, not the virus itself. It's not less deadly than thought. Literally can't keep their 02 sats up. It's... interesting to observe

Testing for the known flu varieties is a simple test but that could be done in a hospital inpatient laboratory.

In one of the steps of diagnosing covid-19 in absence of testing is the elimination of other respiratory viruses.

45% is actually a good year for the flu vaccine.

If you look at the CDC‚Äôs stats for the past 10 years, the effectiveness of the vaccine is usually below 40% and sometimes as low as 20% for a given season.

"High death toll"

CDC reports very detailed national mortality statistics based on the death certificates codification. The data is always couple of weeks behind as it takes some time to collect but it's the most accurate source.

As of 4/11 they have received 13,130 death certificates with the code U07.1 for confirmed or presumed Covid-19 being the cause of death.

55% of those cases (7,269) are people who were 75 years or older - a group where death, statistically and practically, is not considered pre-mature. To put it in perspective, over the same period of time (2/1-4/11) we had 326,904 deaths in this age group from "other causes", approx. 95% of which were "expected" meaning in line with the 3 years average.

Another 36% of deaths (4,692) are in the next cohort of 55-74 years old. The group where maybe death is not so common, but yet starts taking its toll on people with morbid obesity, diabetes, and heart conditions. In the past two months we saw 188,526 people in this age group die from other causes, again mostly in line with average.

Finally, a grand total of 9% or 1,169 deaths are among "young people" below 55 years old. This is on top of 67,105 "other" deaths in a normal course of life.

This is the group with 22 million unemployed, burning through 401k and savings, losing its businesses, and trying to educate kids without schools. While 72% of Americans belong to this group, they own less than 43% of US wealth. They are the ones paying for all of this insanity.

Why are people saying coronavirus doesnt live on food? Ive seen SO many posts of people saying its okay to eat out as long as you take the food out of the package and wash your hands before eating.

The virus can live on metal for days but will die the second it hits a spicy chicken sandwich from chicfila? That dont make no damn sense

There are a couple of things:

Heating the food would render the virus inactive.

Infection is via eyes or lungs. No evidence yet your stomach acid doesn't kill it.

So you could in theory get the virus from non-cooked food just like any other surface. So wash your vegetables.

Also, just to be super clear - viruses don't 'live' like bacteria do, so they can't replicate outside of a host.

Viruses die in heat. Any cooking at proper temperatures will kill the virus.

As long as a covid-19 positive person doesn't sneeze into the food after it's cooked, it is perfectly safe to eat take out food that's been cooked.

the coronavirus can live on food as well as it can live on a table or your phone. viruses in general are fairly fragile therefor, in theory, stomach acid/enzymes in your saliva could possibly denature the virus on your food to the point it can no long effectively infect a healthy cell. you'd probably be more likely to become infected during your transaction with the person giving you the food so wear your face mask and wash your hands.

Unless you plan to put the food into your lungs, it doesnt matter if the virus is on it. There is some incredibly small chance that the virus is on the surface of your food, and smears on the surface of your mouth, and then gets brought into your windpipe later on, but it is a crazy small one.

In all of the cases that have been tracked around the world, none of have been shown to be food-borne. The digestive tract kills this thing and the trace contacts along the way are just not enough to get you sick.

I just read the article about the South Dakota pork processing plant with hundreds of sick employees, and that they continued to work for a full two weeks after some people there tested positive.

What about all of that pork? Meat cutters have been Covid-coughing all over that meat for weeks and now it's all shipped off to market...? Freezing it would just preserve the virus, no?

I don't know about waiting until a vaccine but I'll at least wait until I know the hospital situation is under control, because I don't want to be the reason somebody else has to wait longer for treatment. Because a few weeks or even a few months won't seem like that big of a deal when it's all over, and it's worth it to save lives.

that's what keeps blowing my mind. this herd immunity shit, let everyone get sick, and restart in two weeks or something crap. do they realize that the economy would tank many times worse than a controlled shut down? even if 2% is correct (plot twist: it's not 2% if hospitals are overwhelmed, see lombardy and NYC if you don't believe me) and that's all that die, the funerals alone would cripple the country for weeks. the deaths of health care workers would cripple the health care system for years. nursing home industry would shut down. it would be crematoria in the US that start burning 24/7 for two weeks like wuhan or we'd see the mass graves dug like in iran. that doesn't even account for those who are taking weeks or months to recover.

There‚Äôs a third option. For the USA, Andrew Yang has a whole budget in place for a UBI of $1,000/month with a VAT of 10% and about 6 other smaller tax shifts to round it out. That one is all ready to go.

He has since said that for the economy wide lockdown, you‚Äôd actually need more like a $2,000 month UBI, at which point you just make the VAT higher.

His original plan also has a Carbon fee starting out at $40/ton. If you don‚Äôt want to spend time fighting about that, just toss it and put the VAT up again. The US has so much room for a VAT of 20 to 24%. It‚Äôs waaaaaay undertaxed compared to other first world nations. People in the USA don‚Äôt feel that way, because they personally don‚Äôt see much back from their taxes.

People in high taxed nations who get ‚Äòfree‚Äô healthcare, ‚Äòfree‚Äô university, and lifelong unemployment benefits if we need that - we still piss and moan a bit, but we generally don‚Äôt feel way overtaxed. I can tell you, if I was getting $2,000 a month I would be happy for my 10% GST (our version of VAT) to go up to 24%.

The nice thing about a UBI-VAT system is it‚Äôs self correcting, and also will act as a stimulus during lockdown, while automatically making more tax back when the lockdown ends.

If you‚Äôre earning under $2,000 a month, you‚Äôll get more in UBI than you pay out in VAT. If you spend over $20,000 a month, you‚Äôll pay more VAT than you get in UBI.

You would think that the fact that most U.S states have seen at least a 20% decline in daily new cases from their peak would be a major headline story, yet I see no headlines for it or anyone talking about it. Just more doom and gloom

If anyone is curious about this data, WaPro has it nicely laid out all the way at the bottom of this article for each state

The deaths are a lagging indicator. Deaths today are from cases that were reported weeks ago. You'll see less and less cases with deaths still keeping at highs for a while longer.

Confirmed cases can be manipulated by reducing testing. Which is happening.

Deaths can be manipulated too. Or just undercounted. That is happening also, resulting in corrections. But it's harder for the federal government to manipulate the death count from day to day.

Where are you getting that reduced testing is happening? We've been consistently doing 100-150k tests a day since the end of March.

Reported testing has gone from 100000 a day (april 2nd) to 75,000(april 16th) a day. (on further review of the data set it only accounts for two-thirds of the testing apparatus in the country)

Not sure where you are getting your data from:

Look at the "New Tests" column. The US has been consistently doing 100-150k test a day since the end of March.

Any advice for an angry parent who is saying Covid-19 was from a lab in Wuhan and "that's just a fact" and how the only thing left to figure out is if they released it on purpose or not? Mostly, I just try to present dry, clinical data along with general cautionary advice.

Which actually does kinda work, but they've been repeating the bio lab conspiracy a lot lately. I've tried ignoring it, but that only keeps it from poisoning our relationship, it does nothing to convince them to join reality and stop obsessing and getting worked up.

I mean... is that really a harmful belief in the immediate term? If I'm wearing a mask and social-distancing and taking protective measures, does it really matter whether I strongly think China made this virus in a lab?

I question whether it's a fight worth having.

Yeah, I guess it hits home because I have friends from China and too often, and too quickly, something like "blaming China" can turn into "blaming anyone they think looks Chinese".

Not that my parents would ever be violent or even unkind, but they're propagating the kind of crap that eventually leads to people that aren't kind and nonviolent.

Reddit forgets that most of the US isn't anywhere near as jam-packed as our city centers. I still think public transport in NY was the major reason for the spread. In most places, including many major cities, almost everyone has cars. As long as we shut down big gatherings like sporting events and junk, while putting forward mask orders in public, we should be fine.

And the reason is, I think, density of population. Miami-Dade density is only 1400 per square mile, compared to New York City with 26,000 and LA with 7500. Starting to look like that makes a major difference in infections and deaths, especially with any kind of social distancing.

I heard that Florida is opening beaches and Texas is opening their parks soon. On the west coast, we're at a large lockdown and will be THE ONLY PART OF THE COUNTRY TO GET BETTER. Eventually, the central and eastern regions will get sick and won't be a good place to live in. The west coast would lock out any travel from the central and eastern regions because they are reopening stuff TOO EARLY. If they want to get through this then Trump will have to place a country wide lockdown like what Italy has. Who cares if you pray when you die? This is a serious issue, we're almost at 1m cases IN JUST THE US. This means 1m possible deaths. With this many cases, the health system will be stressed beyond repair and medical workers will have to work overtime just to barely make a dent. This is not just some school shooting, this is literally the worst thing that is happening and I see it as the WHO's priority. Trump should STOP CARING ABOUT BUSINESSES AND CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE. Sorry if this is political or if your religious and don't like this but this is reality and we need to get rid of this virus. There's people risking their lives to help others whether its doctors or people like me who are delivering with Doordash or ringing your food up at Chipotle.

Edit: Don't say to "stop panicking". I'm trying to inform and I'm worried about my mom who has a compromised immune system. Do you realize how worried I am? If I come into contact with someone who's got the virus, my mom could die.

literally none of the number reflect this. But June 1 we're down to a handful of cases. Viruses don't just keep going and going full throttle. That's not how things work. They cycle. We are predicted to cycle down within the next WEEKS and at this point.

Ok, so my mom is from northern wisconsin and visited my sister in idaho right when shit hit the fan. She's been quarantined there for over a month but wants to get back home to her dogs... And husband.

We're trying to decide if renting a car and driving (perhaps even sleeping in the car but she's almost 70) or flying would be safer. I keep seeing and hearing how flights barely have any people on them. I don't honestly like the idea of her driving that far herself. My sister has four kids in a pretty small house so I think for everyone's sanity it's time she heads home

Drive. Biggest risk point would be the rental car itself and any stops (gas, food) made along the way. Take some sanitizing wipes and hand sanitize and use both liberally whenever something is to be touched. Starting with completely sanitizing the rental car.

Since there‚Äôs no posting text posts on the main sub let me put this out here.

Wife‚Äôs (really girl friend) dad is dying of cancer she wants to go to another state to be with him (medium infection state with bad response and leadership we‚Äôre coming from within 60 miles of ground zero so not a better place) quarantining in an Airbnb for 2 weeks on arrival.

She wants us all to go. I‚Äôm fine with her going but not trying to get stuck far from home during the zombie apocalypse. She may have calmed down by now idk but she wants to take the baby even if I don‚Äôt go.

I think we‚Äôre safer with our current supplies and I‚Äôm just starting to get comfortable with the situation as it is.

We‚Äôd have to resupply down there, not to mention travel on an airplane, who knows who was last in the Airbnb and what stupid decisions the govt will take down there. Then be stuck for a month minimum between quarantine and her seeing her father. We won‚Äôt have all the toys and things for the baby/ toddler and I would be stuck in an unfamiliar place twiddling my thumbs.

Is it wrong of me not to follow her through the fire? I mean sometimes in zombie movies someone has some important issues or needs to check on family and it‚Äôs heroic to go with them but often those others don‚Äôt have anywhere particularly better to be.

I feel children fare better if they get the disease but I worry if she goes alone with the baby and something happens to her the baby will be stuck with an elderly grandmother and dying grandfather until I get there to pick her up. and whom have 2 nurses in and out daily plus a pt and ot therapists 1-2 times a week so feel there‚Äôs a chance her mother may not last long in such a situation herself. All of them are high risk between age and obesity.

What would you do? I would never demand she or the baby put themselves in danger if I had to go somewhere for a month.

That‚Äôs what happened to the county where I live. We‚Äôre like an hour or a little more outside of the city, and a LOT of people live here and work in the city, or live in the city and have second homes or vacation homes here. When this first started a lot of people got spooked and moved to their second/vacation homes and brought the virus with them. They actually had to start banning Air BnBs and such because of how many people were fleeing here. For a pretty rural area, we have a lot of cases.

I'm so confused about what the plan is going forward. Is the pandemic starting to clear up? The news makes it sound like we've passed the peak and are on our way back to normal. Not to be too petty but my fiance and I were supposed to be eloping this June and we had decided to most likely post pone until next year as the beaches, vacation rentals, hotels, salons, photographers, officiants, etc would most likely not be open/operating at that time. Now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun because suddenly it sounds like things will be opening back up in May?? Just wondering about y'all's opinions.

I think you made the right choice. Even if we do ‚Äúopen up‚Äù again in May, it‚Äôll be a process, not a free for all‚Äîmore about slowly getting the workforce back out there; travel like that still isn‚Äôt going to be safe/recommended in June, is my bet.

There‚Äôs no chance anything truly opens until June/July. Some dumb governors will reopen beaches etc and will have a new spike. We‚Äôre averaging 2k deaths per day and still 25k-30k new cases per day. Americans are just getting cabin fever and this is about to turn into a real shitshow.

Hopefully I'm thinking ours won't- we live in Oregon and Kate Brown has been really conservative and cautious about everything.

Sad to hear that they're downplaying the seriousness of the issue, I know many people who will probably start to behave as if the risk has passed if things keep up this way.

If you have a place you can quarantine it for at least a week (garage/covered patio/spare room) I think it would be ok. Obviously take all the precautions upon picking it up and after you bring it home. If there‚Äôs no fabric involved - you can easily wipe it down.

How quickly does Coronavirus symptoms exhibit themselves ?

For the past few days I thought I had Gerd symptoms. Burping, heartburn/acid reflux.

Today I keep burping or feel the need to burp. Can‚Äôt lay down flat. And my face is getting warmer. I have no cough or sneezing or anything like that. Am I basically getting the symptoms for covid-19?

Does not sound like Covid-19 at all but you should call a doctor. Could be a hiatal hernia, among other things.

A lot of posts remind me of a book, Barbara Ehrenreich's Bright Sided. In it she details how 'positive thinking' helped bring about the 2008 financial crisis.

Latching onto any 'good news' (real or hype- ie, treatments that don't actually work) is a sure way to lessen one's dealing with reality, and make this situation even worse down the line.

Telling people 'it's almost over' will just guarantee more people let down their guard.

"how businneses run and in general how a modern civilization functions"

United States is not a modern civilization. Businesses running on the concept of infinite growth is a fallacy.

Plenty of other countries show that businesses as well as their customers can survive a lock-down, and society does not collapse when both supply and demand crater.

I am going to remind everyone of this again:

You know how it was an incredibly shortsighted decision to wait to implement measures until covid had already infected enough of any given country to make contact-tracing and other methods of eradication nearly impossible?

It's going to be equally, if not far more due to the long-ranging effects caused by everything shutting down, harmful and shortsighted to wait to lift measures until you've done irreparable harm to the economy - and by this I'm not talking about rich CEOs getting richer, they're irrelevant, I'm talking about people being able to afford food and rent (no government assistance is going to be enough after a point), supply chains potentially breaking down, infant mortality skyrockets (can't wait to see the "every life matters" people on this one) and the effects on non-covid patients.

Let me clarify - the lockdowns were correct. We had no data back then and the worst case scenario was too daunting. Keeping the lockdowns completely is starting to become more and more incorrect as we start realising that the virus is not that deadly and hospitals continue to be very much not overwhelmed. Social distancing is still going to be important for a long time. That's not the same thing as lockdowns.

Hey raddaya, it depends which country we¬¥re talking about, because they are all in a different phase of this. Where are you?

I¬¥m in Germany and I think you are not completely wrong. We have kept this under control with the lockdowns in terms of death rates and our government is thinking about different levels of reopening the economy.

However, it is indispensable that

a) social distancing is kept in place. And that requires a lot of cooperation by the people. I hope we all are smart enough to understand that and live by it, and

b) the country has sufficient testing capacities and a strategy to isolate cases and protect risk groups.

Otherwise the case numbers will just explode again and we have the same situation as before the lockdowns.

Controversial opinion alert: schools and colleges have to open next academic year no matter what. Aside from the psychological impacts it can have on kids and teens if they have to stay away from school and friends for that long, schools and colleges are by far the most important institutions in shielding against an economic collapse.

Don‚Äôt panic. South Korea, Taiwan, and Denmark opened schools. They shut down early, so it never got as bad as France and Spain. Many countries are creating plans to open schools for next academic year.

Nobody knows the amount of cases, the testing is so far behind that the currently confirmed cases are nowhere representative of the actual cases - so that calculation wouldn't give any meaningful result.

Actually, it's the less serious threats that are the most daunting. SARS-1 was far more serious, with a 10% mortality rate, we (albeit barely) managed to contain it due to it being completely obvious if someone was sick which means it's not easy to spread.

Life isn't Plague Inc where viruses "know" how to both have a long incubation period while being contagious and be high mortality, that's really not how biology works. So that's why I don't think it's likely that a high mortality rate virus would have doomed the world; it's these low-but-not-low-enough mortality rates which are very easy to spread, like the more dangerous strains of flu and covid19, which are the most daunting.

Evolution makes all the things. And the vast, vast majority of them don't work. They're stillborn or they don't compete well in their origin environment.

By our actions we force the evolution of these viruses into the shape of the holes in our defenses. Too deadly too quickly like Ebola we react and stomp it out. It's a local tragedy. Not fatal for a long time, like HIV, it can circulate and spread for a long time before it is detected. It becomes a global health problem but to hide so well it is dependent on a means of spread that is easy to mitigate (unprotected sex).

Nature rolls the dice every day. This time she came up with one that has symptoms identical to a mere annoyance most of the time. It emerged in a place and time where it didn't spread to people likely to die for a while. It's most contagious before symptoms appear. It spreads quite readily, but people don't fear it, until it's too late to contain it.

The virus has these parameters because we quickly defeated all the ones that didn't. Nature tries all the things, and eventually she found a key that fit in the lock we had made. In a sense, this virus is like it is because we demanded it to be. And this is one hole that should be relatively easy to weld shut.

also, just 50 years ago we wouldn't blink an eye for that mortality rate. Hell, we would probably even have so many people age 65+ around to get it.

In NYC, the "pre-mature" mortality rate (younger than 65) went up to a level seen as recently as 2008, just a decade ago.

We just developed very high standards for how good healthcare should be and a tendency to complain about life.

List of Countries that have a higher death rate than the USA per 1m residents.

Belgium - 445

Spain - 413

Italy - 367

France - 275

UK - 202

Netherlands - 202

Switzerland - 149

Sweden - 139

Luxembourg - 110

USA - 105

Yet some how the narrative is that the US is doing poorly compared to European countries with socialized medicine.

Also, it should be noted that the US rate of 105 deaths per 1m is skewed by NY.

NY - 873

NJ - 432

Connecticut - 289

Louisiana - 260

Michigan - 224

Massachusetts - 206

Rhode Island - 112

No other state is above 100

NY has OVER 20X more deaths per 1m than these following states

Ohio - 36

Florida - 35

Wisconsin - 35

Oklahoma - 35

Alabama - 31

Kentucky - 31

Missouri - 30

Kansas - 29

New Hampshire - 28

California - 27

Virginia - 27

Idaho - 25

Arizona - 24

New Mexico - 24

South Carolina - 23

Maine - 22

Tennessee - 21

Iowa - 20

Minnesota - 20

North Carolina - 17

Oregon - 17

Texas - 16

Nebraska - 13

Arkansas - 12

North Dakota - 12

Alaska - 12

West Virginia - 9

Utah - 8

South Dakota 8

Montana - 8

Hawaii - 6

Wyoming - 3

For even more context, influenza (last flu season) killed 103 people per 1m residents in the US.

Thanks to NY and NJ we will finish well above that, but the other 48 states are hovering around 55 deaths per 1m right now.

Yes this is much worse than Influenza but we need to be honest about what is going on. When you see these numbers, you can see why so many Americans are getting frustrated. NY is dictating how they should live when they don't have the problem NY has

We're four weeks in and you're using totals to say "this isn't as bad as the last flu."

Give me a comparison against four weeks of flu data then we can talk.

Here in Europe most people are pretty aware that Spain, Italy and the UK are doing worse than the USA. However there are some measures by which the USA is arguably doing worse: with such a massive proportion of active cases and so few recoveries compared to deaths, its proving more lethal for people without access to medicine, and the high number of active cases means its about to get a hell of a lot worse unless something changes. Spain and Italy are flattening the curve, albeit insufficiently - the UK and the USA on the other hand simply are not.

Death is a lagging indicator.

Check out the the graphs of daily new deaths for some of the hardest hit countries on worldometer.info. Spain and Italy have peaked days/weeks ago while the graph for the US is still on an upswing. CFR will rise here as well. Let's just hope it won't rise to the same level. .

This is a weird outbreak for sure. Reading about historical pandemics, you get the idea it processes through a population in a pretty deterministic way. Sure, if you're poor, or there's dense population, or you're not taking common-sense precautions because we didn't know about germs yet, it'll go worse. But the basic spread is usually presented as sort of having this simple, understandable, natural pace, like fire burning through dry grass.

But here you can list by rich countries, poor countries, dense cities, socialized medicine, climate... there isn't just one experience of this disease. There isn't just one course.

I think there are important things going on here we still don't know.

It's much too early to say that the rest of the country won't get much worse than it is now. Obviously New York is skewing things right now, it's one if the most (if not the most) populated areas in the country.

My worry is the rest of the country will react like a frog in a boiling water. Obviously states in the south will never ever put up numbers like New York, and that could be even more dangerous. People will look at the numbers in less populated states like Kentucky and Tennessee and say, "overblown" but i would think a death toll of 10k a day in those states would be devastating.

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any publicly available data like this. The other day, I was trying to figure out a way to quantify how well a state or country is doing with containment. I worked out the percentage of infection by calculating what percent the total number of cases is out of the population. Yesterday there was about 600,000 cases in the US and there‚Äôs about 330,000,000 people in the US. That‚Äôs 0.19% spread through the population.

I know that this percentage by itself isn‚Äôt a true measure of containment. The number of days since patient 0 is a relevant variable. Say for instance one country is 0.19% at 50 days, and one is 0.19% at 20 days. The first one is an theoretical indication of better containment.

Would this actually be a valid calculation? Is there some math I don‚Äôt remember that can be a coefficient or something of the percentage to days to quantify a ‚Äúcontainment score‚Äù so to speak? I realized there are tons of real world variables that aren‚Äôt quantifiable, such as testing availability, population density, etc etc... BUT it still would be an interesting statistic to see and see the ‚Äúscore‚Äù for states or counties are doing at containment in comparison to others.

some of the sites are using doubling time or time to x10, so you can find charts that start the graph at case 10, case 100, case 1000, case 10000 and look at the different shapes or you can look at the doubling time changes

Isn't this an important question we all should be asking? What if all the countries we are appreciating for testing are using rapid antibody tests ? Their efficiency is not good enough and it has certain exceptions too.

Don't send international mail to the UK. I wanted to send my sister a present since she is over there away from family and probably lonely. I sent it express, and package tracking says it's left the USA a week ago and never arrived. She spoke to USPS and Royal Mail about it, and they say on the phone that Britain is "prioritizing medical supplies" and sticking all other incoming parcels in a huge bin somewhere. It may be a long time before she gets it or it gets returned to me. Worryingly, USPS and Royal Mail websites say nothing about this, but both positively confirmed on the phone that this is happening.

They add a bunch of cases some days, if you check the chart you can see it (especially Apr. 3): https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/

As said, probably confirmed cases outside of hospitals (nursing homes.)

Could be, people in nursing homes have been dying like flies around here. They found 17 corpses in a nursing home near here the day before yesterday when they went to investigate a complaint about the place.

Essential here! The work I do depends on small businesses... we had modified schedules to allow separation of people to prevent spread. Just got told we are going to go back to 5 days a week full staff........ 10 people in a small area and we literally don't have work because again the small businesses are closed.

I'm in Riverside county and I heard from several nurses, that in hospitals, they are only testing front line people like Drs, nurses, police, etc. due to limited supplies like swabs. Especially Kaiser Permanente. They could be pushing yours aside for those people. It would also indicate that the count is low due to that reason.

My research advisor is a dean at a large state university. They‚Äôre definitely talking about keeping things online, but it‚Äôs really not ideal so I think they‚Äôre trying to figure out if there‚Äôs anyway they could resume in person. One thing they‚Äôre considering is only allowing some students back, e.g. having international students still be online since visas and the like can‚Äôt go through right now.

I think it will be by state and region. I could see CUNY in NYC being online line (since it is a commuter school mostly) but in states that did not get hit hard or universities in rural areas, they will likely be on campus.

In some jurisdictions they are still having deaths while running significantly under capacity. The whole point of the curve was to make sure to not overwhelm the system. Wouldnt it be better to try and get to a point where the system consistently runs at 90% capacity?

Theoretically, yes. The problem is with the nature of exponential growth, the line between "system running near capacity" and "system severely overloaded" is razor sharp. And because the lag between infection and developing serious symptoms can be a few weeks, if an area relaxes its containment measures too much, by the time that becomes evident little can be done to forestall the consequences.

Besides medication, observation and rehydration, there are a lot of Covid patients in hospitals just receiving oxygen. Not everyone who needs to be hospitalized will need a vent.

I think I have [as of yet] mild case of it. Upset stomach for a couple days, very slight headache and stuffiness. Kinda out of it, like a mild cold. Hope it doesn't get worse.

Based on the number of cases in my state-- 2k-- my chances weren't that high of getting this. I think it's a lot more common than what testing suggests. At least in the city.

I hope there aren't any long term consequences.

Taste is fine. Alternating nasal passages are clogged, but it's dry, not runny.

Diarhea is a less common symptom but still known symptom. That combined with the stuffiness and the lingering near-headachd makes me think it's likely.

I had a co worker who developed a lingering cough for multiple weeks a couple weeks ago, 3 weeks into working from home. Lives alone. We both live in the city. I think it's more common in the city.

It‚Äôs a personal choice I guess. People should consider their age and health, if they‚Äôre an at risk group I‚Äôd say no. Driving is probably better. Either way have them quarantine for 14 days when they arrive.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with getting families together under 1 roof, would reduce the number of people going out and risking exposure.

That said, I would strongly not recommend flying, if you‚Äôre doing it, just drive

I talked to someone here just last week who I specifically told him to go when he has been living isolated in a city and his parents told him he could come back to his parents house in the countryside.

Anyone who says it's wrong doesn't understand how important family is. It's a risk and should be discussed among all who will be impacted being sure to give everyone a chance to voice their fears and what they need to feel safe.

The other relatives don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre happy the person flew in. Thank you for your perspective. For me family is not a top value so it‚Äôs good to see a different view. But isn‚Äôt it bad to put your family at risk of getting sick though? You can bring the virus with you...

I don't see it being a problem as long as someone is healthy and takes as many precautions as possible when they travel. If they are in a high risk category, they shouldn't do it - For their own safety and their families safety.

Might not be lines at the airport, I don't know haven't been to one lately.

I‚Äôve been getting stomach issues but I‚Äôve been eating more snack foods and getting more sun (sun makes me physically sick sometimes). It‚Äôs likely just a bug or you ate something unfriendly, or if you have a new routine, it might be an upset to the newness. Best thing you can do is be gentle with yourself and get as much rest as possible.

Has anyone made a graphic to show how well the IHME model has done so far? Even with its confidence intervals? I'm seeing many places go much higher than the high part of the interval and vice versa for the low. I've started to lose a lot of confidence in this model and the whitehouse is using it to justify opening things up ASAP.

Question: Why do all trackers show daily percentages like this: (Active cases 82%, Recovered 12%, Fatal 6%) instead of looking at what comes out of the pipeline, like this: (Recovered 67%, Fatal 33%)?

And if your argument going to be, not all recovered are accounted for, why don't they just do auto-recovery for patients who didn't die, after 20 days?

Because science isn‚Äôt anecdotal? If you have a positive-tested individual who is sent home because they don‚Äôt have a need for hospitalization, they cannot be confirmed as ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô unless they are re-tested, which is rare during a health emergency. The vast majority of the number of confirmed ‚Äòrecoveries‚Äô are coming from hospitals when they actually have a patient discharged.

instead of looking at what comes out of the pipeline, like this: (Recovered 67%, Fatal 33%)?

Because that would be an asinine thing to put out in public. Even the hardest hit localities on the planet don‚Äôt come close to this in case-mortality rate, let alone actual mortality rate. I would really like to understand your reasoning for this comment... I hope you don‚Äôt believe that the numbers should be skewed to show higher death rates.

I am just wondering.

And as I said in the second part of my comment, which i have a feeling you didn't read. why not have a grace period of 20 days, then announce a patient who was sent home as recovered - unless a different update actually happened.

I read your whole comment. The point I was trying to make is something I have been talking about on this sub for while.

The reason that the numbers of ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô is so low is that a person must be actually tested, and shown to have such a small viral load that it is no longer detected, or they have an accurate serological antibody test showing that they contracted the disease and beat it.

Until that is done, a person cannot be ‚Äòassumed‚Äô to be recovered. At some point in the future (hopefully very soon), we will have simple antibody fingerprick tests, and will be able to expand the denominator.

The answer to you original question is that we cannot assume ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô until it is proven, regardless of time. Doing so would be non-scientific, even if it would be helpful or convenient.

It's useful to have more data. By comparing the amount of active cases to the amount of removed, you can have a bit of a guess at how quickly it is spread, how far along in the process the country etc. For example, China has few active cases, the vast majority having been removed, meaning that they seem to be getting the situation under control. However when you look at a country like the UK or Germany you see that there are far more active cases than removed, because the infection took longer to take hold in the country and spread.

You then compare it to Spain, where, despite having the patient zero on the same day as the UK, the infection took hold and spread much faster: we have about 40k cases removed leaving 144k active cases - so still very much spreading, unlike in China, but in the UK they have 14k cases removed an 90k active cases. They have a great proportion of active cases, and are generally considered to be about a week behind Spain in the process, although thanks to their lack of mask wearing it is now spreading considerably faster in the UK, doubling the total amount of cases every fortnight, as opposed to every month in Spain.

He rounded down. Worldometer shows 30,727 new cases for 04/17. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

CDC shows 29k new cases for 04/16. They are one day behind Worldometer.

The economy is linked to so many things like mental health and domestic violence and child abuse. You can't just act like this is about making a buck, that is a gross misunderstanding of how far reaching the "economy" is to everyone's health and well being and happiness.

It‚Äôs impossible for the world to shut down for over a year, both socially and economically. f***, we‚Äôre already seeing some mild unrest right now. Do you really think everyone‚Äôs going to be fine with the way things are currently for another year+?

And besides, the economy being suspended that long is a good way to guarantee something far worse than the Great Recession.

I‚Äôm not saying that the almighty dollar should decide all, and we should reopen now (that‚Äôs f***ing stupid), but it‚Äôd be completely unfeasbile for any country in the world to remain like this for another few months, let alone a year+.

Study out today from Brazil

Results: Of the 636 symptomatic outpatients, 412 started treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and 224 refused medications (control group). Need for hospitalization was 1.9% in the treatment group and 5.4% in the control group (2.8 times greater) and number needed to treat was 28 (NNT = 28). In those who started treatment before versus after the seventh day of symptoms, the need for hospitalization was 1.17% and 3.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Empirical treatment with hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin for suspected cases of COVID-19 infection reduces the need for hospitalization (p< 0.001).

....

There were no serious side effects in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (Table 3). Two patients in the treatment group died during the follow-up; first death was due to acute coronary syndrome and second death due to metastatic cancer. On the treatment group, 1.9% required hospitalization, compared to the control group, which was 5.4% (p < 0.0001). That is, 2.8 times greater need for hospitalization compared to those without medication (Figure 1). It means an Absolute Risk Reduction (RAR) of 3.5% and a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 28 to prevent one hospitalization. When the treatment group was stratified concerning the day of the symptom on which the drugs were started, we observed that patients treated before versus after day 7 of symptoms required less hospitalization (1.17% and 3.2%, respectively 13 p<0.001). Comparing the early treatment (< 7 days of symptoms) to those without treatment (control group) the NNT was 23 (Figure 2)

Multiple studies out of France have now found no benefit, andsome harm , from the treatment.

Using 'suspected' cases, as opposed to confirmed by testing, as the Brasil study does is very flawed, for obvious reasons.

A lot of people no longer desire to extend their life when the quality has diminished to a certain point, that could be a big reason why many in the control group refused medication.

A serious discussion about the effects of COVID on the black community. The only reasonable conclusion is that this is because of systematic racism (African Americans are more likely to live in densely populated areas and work service jobs due). What can be done to help the black community specifically in dealing with COVID-19 and to combat systematic racism?

As part of two Phase 3 clinical trials ‚Äî sponsored by the drug‚Äôs manufacturer, Gilead Sciences ‚Äî the hospital recruited 125 people with COVID-19, 113 with severe cases, according to the report. Each patient had been treated with daily infusions of remdesivir, which works by shutting off the bug‚Äôs ability to replicate inside cells.

Did we already forget about hydrochloroquine? This is nearly identical but a slightly more egregious situation in which the study is being paid for and conducted by the drugs manufacturer. There was no control group just like the hydrochloroquine trial. There was only one study just like the hydrochloroquine trial. And there is massive, market moving hysteria that a cure has been found.. Just like the hydrochloroquine trial.

Most early clinical trials are done by manufacturer. This medication is still in the research phase without widespread availability or even FDA approval.

Preliminary results were promising; it was used in the emergency setting during the Kivu Ebola epidemic that started in 2018, along with further clinical trials, until August 2019, when Congolese health officials announced that it was significantly less effective than monoclonal antibody treatments such as mAb114 and REGN-EB3. The trials, however, established its safety profile.

So a drug that was designed to treat an entirely different class of viruses that are different in every way all the way up to the viruses phylum, with the only similarity being that they exist in the same realm of Riboviria, that was found to be ineffective in treating the virus it was designed for, is somehow very effective at treating an entirely different type of virus?

This is just a company trying to recover R&D on a failed drug.

I think it's really not the time to criticize a drug study for having a weak foundation. If anything the federal government should have spent a chunk of that bailout stimulus bill handing out big checks for research to any company that had a drug that had even a small chance of showing results. We'd be that much further along in this situation and it would arguably have been a better way to spend that money than on a bailout for companies affected by this economic shutdown when there's no concrete plan to even safely reopen the economy.

Hydroxychloroquine is still doing clinical trials. Along with like 6 other medications in the US. This one is starting to make its waves because some local city news network picked up a heartwarming story how they gave it to a patient and they recovered. Big media have grabbed it and so it‚Äôs making the rounds.

Do I have corona virus?

I have asthma and I've been out just because I visit my boyfriend (but we don't see anyone else and neither does his or my family) and I have a sore throat. I took my ear temp which was 99.3, and my mouth temp was 98. I have had a mild headache but not too much trouble breathing. Could I possibly have Corona virus? I have to stop at gas stations and handle money and such.

Loss of taste or smell? Nausea/ vomiting? Muscle aches in your back or neck?

Your symptoms sound mild and could simply be a sore throat. In addition to Corona, there's still the common cold/flu. Regardless, you should call your doctor and try to remain indoors if your still symptomatic. Don't visit your bf or have him visit you. Chill out at home until your symptoms resolve.

Call 911 if you become SOB.

Not an expert, but I'm a firefighter/EMT working in the field. Hope you feel better üò∑.

Could just be a sore throat. We're also noticing that patients have been positive for COVID with a mix of symptoms. Some have only lost their sense of taste and smell where others are experiencing full-on flu symptoms; and everything in between.

Again, call your doctor to see if you should be tested, stay home and isolate. Your BF is basically long-distance until you're feeling well again. Call 911 if you're experiencing breathing difficulties.

Your symptoms are too mild to get tested in most states. Even if you do get tested, they would likely send you home to self-quarantine.

Stay self-aware and monitor your symptoms. If they get worse enough for a test, you may be able to do drive-through testing or contact your county health dept(google them) to get a test.

If you have obesity or hypertension, you are high risk for complications. Keep that in mind.

Doctors don't have many tests in-house, so it can be hard to go through them.

Anything is possible, but those temps don't warrant any concern at all. Doctors wouldn't even call those a fever, as your temperature can fluctuate a little sometimes.

I wouldn't worry until symptoms worsen, but if you are then you should call your doctor and not ask on an Internet forum.

I know this isn‚Äôt a legit place to ask this question, but I‚Äôm doing it anyways. When do I go get checked out for real. I talked with my dr and the biggest thing I had was persistent chest pain and it‚Äôs been about a week now. 2 days ago (after seeing my dr) I developed more symptoms: cough, headache and fever, sore throat. It‚Äôs really just this constant strain that‚Äôs in my chest that‚Äôs making me worried. I‚Äôm taking anti anxiety medication that I was prescribed because my dr was thinking it could just be anxiousness.

I think it‚Äôs time to seek out testing. Increased anxiety does commonly cause chest tightness and can worsen other symptoms, and maybe it‚Äôs just that. Given the context we‚Äôre currently in however it is well worth your time to get tested, specifically with the symptoms you report. Please note that I am in no way qualified to give medical advice, I‚Äôm just explaining what I would do in that scenario.

Perhaps prefacing your question with 'this isn't a legit place to ask' is not the best way to get good answers.

Nevertheless, based on your symptoms you'd be considered a 'presumptive positive' and will continue to be even if you do manage to get tested and the test comes back negative.

Stay home, and watch out for your symptoms getting worse. It gets worse fast. Chances are however, it'll stay bad for a few days and maybe take you on a little rollercoaster, then gradually improve.

If you have symptoms go get check at the emergency room of a hospital. I assume you‚Äôre not Canadian, but here in Quebec (travelled from Ontario about 8days ago and had the same symptoms) I was able to go to the pandemic tent get a mouth and nose swab and go home. The whole process took about 5 minutes and I got my Results in less than 24 hours. I came back negative and haven‚Äôt left the house since. I get all my groceries delivered now with contactless delivery and plan to stay that way until it‚Äôs safe. I guess I was just unlucky enough to get the flu.

Warning if you do go though, the nose swab is really painful they get in there real good. Felt like they were swabbing my brain.

Best of luck!

most hospital chains have nurse lines you can call 24/7 now. are you stressed or anxious? if so, find some coping/calming mechanisms so you can rule that out as a cause. i don't think any of us is likely qualified to diagnose or whatever, but many states are shifting their testing capacity towards healthier people so they can open up faster, maybe you can get into one of those drive up kind of clinics to get your brain tickled

In 4 months (Jan to April) = roughly 154000 deaths globally.

In 12 to 18 months = approx 930000 deaths if lockdowns are lifted prematurely?

There are now doubts being raised about antibody tests which would seriously thwart any lift of the lockdown

Apparently there is uncertainty about a) their reliability and b) whether if someone does indeed have antibodies, whether they are actually immune - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52335210

This in turn creates doubts about the supposed vaccine if it is ever made- if antibodies are not as effective as we thought, a vaccine which creates mock antibodies, will also not provide any immunity and risk of infection and passing the virus still remain

We are officially at a critical juncture. If the scientists now confirm antibodies do not offer immunity, we are f***ed worse than we thought

A person doesn't necessarily have to have detectable antibodies after infection to be able to make them again once re-exposed. Also, antibodies are only one piece of the immune system. All the evidence we have says reinfection is not happening.

Vaccines, by the time they are approved, are tested well and should work. That doesn't mean we don't also put time and money into treatments. If we can prevent deaths now instead of waiting for a vaccine, why the hell wouldn't we. But generating fear and coming to quick scary conclusions because of questionable antibody tests is not what we should be doing.

Given that the US is one of only two known nations hanging on to live smallpox cultures, (after it has been driven extinct in the rest of the world), and most major powers have research labs on dangerous pathogens - I‚Äôd presume an accidental release unless there is a smoking gun proving China released it on purpose. Into their own population first.

If it‚Äôs an accidental release, that‚Äôs something that could have happened from dozens of nations, many of whom merely study deadly pathogens for scientific and medical reasons.

in terms of coping, it changes nothing

in terms of the Administration turning the spotlight from its deadly mis-handling of the first 6 weeks and now testing, there should be great cause for concern. If we re-elect even more people will die as this pandemic will last well into 2021.

NY has obviously done it, dumping most of the numbers into 1 date. I have a feeling we'll be getting more adjustments like that, but not as big. The actual daily numbers was pretty low yesterday, at least to what they have been.

NY actually posted the daily counts for all those deaths but most of the aggregate sites dumped them all into one day. i'm not sure why tbh. i meant to post a link to the daily adjusted counts but i couldn't find it in my history from where i'd commented the numbers but no citation.

i have mixed feelings about all that. the deniers are already talking about inflated numbers and treating covid differently than any other disease. so this will make that problem worse, but it does make things much more accurate to determine the true impact.

edit: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/13/deaths-from-cardiac-arrests-have-surged-in-new-york-city gives a graph that sheds a bit of light on the situation

That jump is from reclassifying previous deaths. A lot of countries are now adding 'probable' deaths in their counts now. See the bottom of https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/

There is also more cases being detected, they've been actively stomping down additional cases as they find them.

Weird question but I have no idea where else to ask and my Googling hasn't turned anything up. Has anyone had people driving by honking for minutes at a time? I can only assume it's related to COVID-19, it's too frequent to be at shift change for healthcare workers and there's not even a medical facility nearby as far as I know. Is this a kind of protest? I've seen some of the cars have flyers taped on the windows but I can't make out the details.

So when we finally get a vaccine how does this all play out?

I am curious to know what the process is going to be once this vaccine is created. What are the odds of herd immunity and actually getting a vaccine before 2023? In the movie contagion which has been very accurate to our current situation they do a lottery by birthdays. I would like to know if anyone has any insight on how this would play out. It is a very warm and fuzzy feeling to say we will have a vaccine within 18 months, but what is the REAL timetable until I am actually getting a needle in my arm? I can hardly get toilet paper

I don't think it will look like Contagion the movie. The first vaccines to be released will be quite rushed and either not too effective or have significant side effects. I think we will end up with a bunch of competing vaccines, some will be better for the general population but is too dangerous for the immunocompromised, some will have more protective effects but require more frequent boosters, etc. Given the rush it is unlikely that the first vaccine to get approved is going to be the ideal one for most people. But we will take anything that comes out and find an appropriate population to use it.

My parents are going to drive to Vegas from SF this weekend to see the house they just bought (which was before this whole quarantine hit) and get a transfer to their work location. This is obviously essential as they cannot not have a job when they make the move.

I've been feeling anxious all night and I cannot stop overthinking. I made sure they pack a whole bag of sanitary items and not leave their hotel room unless absolutely necessary (e.g: checking the house and going to the work facility).

I just hate how unfortunate the timing is. Add in the fact that they have to go back to work after this trip and then deal with more people. This is driving me crazy

Silly question maybe, but I live in Australia. My family lives in the Netherlands. We chat regularly and everyone in the Netherlands says it's going well and everyone is kind of lax with the rules it seems. People visit each other on the other side of the country, do stuff together etc.

Yet I look at their numbers and see their active case numbers consistently going up. Yet when I bring this up, they say "oh no, those numbers are wrong, we're definitely over the peak."

I don't get it. Is someone able to tell me what I'm missing?

The arguments I hear most is:

The Netherlands doesn't test much and was late to get started with testing. Alright. Doesn't that mean that the numbers of infected people is likely significantly higher than it currently is?

Yes, the active cases go up, but hospitalisation is going down. There's less people in the hospitals, which is a good indication that it's going well. Alright, so you have more people that become sick, but less people in the hospitals. How is that possible? Are they just not admitting people as easily anymore?



Am I missing something? I would love for the Netherlands to be alright, but my 65+ year old parents have my brothers and their partners over that live in both corners of the country and they tell us that they think Australia is a bit over the top with our lockdowns etc. That makes me very nervous.

A vaccine is 12 months or more away. By that time the supply chains will have dried up as most people scrounge for food or go back to work in rural area pulling plows for the farmers cause there is no gasoline or diesel and that is the only place to get a reliable source of food. The best course is to wait until May 1 and see where we are. In some places, like NY, the lockdown should probably stay in place until May 15 and then were see where things are.

I find this place too abusive to really be worth it. People that support the World Health Organisation just constantly abuse and harass if you criticise it.

Edit: 7 minutes in and I'm already called a Russian bot. That's what I'm talking about.

The hospitals not being overrun are evidence that social distancing is working, not evidence that we don't need to social distance.

This is literally the exact opposite of the truth. There is no way we‚Äôre staying below 60k. The model is off in the wrong direction for deaths . I will concede that it way overshot hospitalizations.

It was wrong in two different directions for two different factors. It‚Äôs a bad model

Turns out you overestimate the number of beds needed when hundreds of people a day are just dying at home rather than going to the hospital.

It‚Äôs pretty telling of reddit‚Äôs and MSM bias with how they portray a protest. Michigan‚Äôs protest, all you saw in the news were the few hundred MAGA people looking sketchy as hell on capital lawns. They talked about how hospitals were blocked. They paint the entire protest in a light of hate and negativity.

Well my aunt and uncle were there, they came from SW Michigan with a caravan of other small business owners. There were upwards of 10 thousand vehicles, protesting black and white laws applying to the whole state. Can you blame them? Small businesses are dying and nobody is even listening. My aunt and uncles small business is landscape architecture, they literally would have 1 man sites, THEY f***ING FILL GAS UP AT A FARM, THEY DONT EVEN TOUCH GAS STATION PUMPS. The CDC CISA and USDA have all said lawn care is ok. Now is an extremely important time to get herbicides and pesticides down to help cut back on ticks, mosquitoes, invasive plant species, and overall nasty things like poison ivy. They start huge architecture projects now. They‚Äôre entire season will be impacted and if they lose their job, their whole family, and the families of the workers will suffer. They have extremely low cases in rural areas, and being open WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON COVID NUMBERS.

They had very legitimate reasons to protest. They want common sense grey areas so the disease doesn‚Äôt become more destructive than it should. Yet you have people painting them as villains. You have people on Facebook sharing posts saying ‚Äúif you agree with these protests, just block me I will not listen I do not agree‚Äù

They said from the start their protest was not to downplay Covid. A vast majority of people stayed in cars, did a loop around the capital, and went home. Spokespeople from the hospital came out and said incoming patients were not impacted by traffic.

Meanwhile any social rights protest will have every armchair expert up in arms at anyone trying to critique it. Just goes to show how much political bias is used to spin something so complex to turn a protest by small business owners into a protest by Gun wielding MAGA people.

Yeah I think mixed messaging and political bias are at play here. On one hand, the protest was organized by Betsy Devos and coined "operation gridlock". The goals of the protest - reopening some businesses while adhering to social distancing guidelines - were lost amid a sea of maga hats who turned it into a Trump rally/democrat governor lady bad protest.

CNN and MSNBC are going to report on the Maga morons who 1000% don't take COVID seriously and think the economy is more important. There's no money in reporting on concerned sbo's. Then, Fox is going to report on the hero patriots "standing up to tyranny". Basically the reverse of BLM marches

I have no hope for the future anymore. Infections are just going to go up once restrictions are relaxed and it‚Äôll be a cycle for years. I‚Äôll have to start grad school online and won‚Äôt pass. Colleges will lose money because so many people drop out and programs will get cut and entire colleges will shut down. There are no distractions from this for me anymore. There‚Äôs never been a Coronavirus vaccine before and there still isn‚Äôt one for HIV. Herd immunity won‚Äôt happen. I don‚Äôt see how we aren‚Äôt going to live in a permanent dystopia. The economy will be at a permanent third world level.

We don't need to know what each of your minor US politicians has to say, this sub is infested with US politics themed topics and the ones focused on other countries and COVID19 related issues are drowned out. There's a USA coronavirus subreddit use that for your minor political info and such



One again I come to this post to complain about this

it's sickening.

We can't get anything through that isn't centered around America, the world isn't America, this isn't a US exclusive subreddit, America isn't the world.

I'm beyond frustrated because topics about minor events, politicians and people in the US are upvoted to high heaven where as other topics just as relevant tend to be ignored.



There is a coronavirus USA subreddit, use that for this stuff, only post major things related to the US here.

It protects themself from the virus. Not all protective gear, measures, or motivations are to help other people. So its not useless for someone to wear gloves and not change them.

If you get the virus on your hand and there is a cut or abrasion, the virus can enter your body and infecr you. You are wearing gloves and the vjrus gets on the surface of your glove... nothing happens.

I think that my point refuted your claim that they "do nothing." And viruses are small, they could probably find their way undernearh a bandaid easier than all the way down the outside of the glove and back up the inside. But i also dont know why you are being so weird about it, gloves are a good idea. And viruses can enter microabrasions that you can't detect with the naked eye so the bandaid idea isnt really a catch all like a glove. Its like saying masks arent really worth it when you could just not breath in peoples cough-mist or something.. why not do the safer option?

Most of the time when they wear gloves they never change them anyway so it doesn't matter if they are or not. Gloves are supposed to be an easy external layer you change between contacts, but if you never change them it's literally the same as not washing your hands.

Can someone check my math here-

Death rates for corona is 0.5%, only 20% of people on ventilators live, so flattening the curve saves 0.1% people.

Is this correct?

I don‚Äôt understand the question. Flattening the curve keeps people off of ventilators and makes sure there are enough ventilators available for everyone that needs one

you're assuming ventilators are the only thing that hospitals do to improve outcomes. The death rate among confirmed cases in Lombardy, Italy where hospitals were overrun is like 18%. To that you'll say, surely there were way more unconfirmed cases than the confirmed number shows. Well that's obvious, but do you really believe that 100% of the difference is due to unconfirmed cases and 0% of the difference is due to the lack of oxygen masks and noninvasive ventilators for those who were severe but not critical.

Most people who need hospitalization don't need ventilators, they need supplemental oxygen, hydration, and close monitoring. Ventilators are for the worst cases, it's a last ditch effort to save someone. And ventilators are not the only resource that is maxed out.

Also 0.1% is no small fries. 0.1% of the US population is 330,000.

Edit: also we don't really know what the death rate is yet...

ventilators are irrelevant to the question you're asking. flattening the curve saves 100% of people who could have been saved by a hospital that runs out of beds (or ventilators, or PPE). flattening the curve also saves the lives of first responders which makes your community safer and gives you a better chance to live when you catch it later

It's not 1,200 deaths in one day, it is 1,200 newly counted deaths. You can only test so many bodies, be them dead or alive, at once. So, with the infection rate being low for them they can now catch up with the backlog of dead persons and testing if they had it or not.

We shut down the world economy, killed small businesses, self imposed the largest spike in unemployment in history, and brought on a recession, over a literal flu.

Right. So, about that...

If this is accurate generally, we are looking at a CFR that is a fraction of 1%, likely significantly under 0.1%. Which would be around, or possibly even less than, the seasonal flu.

The state of New York has 17,131 deaths so far, on a population of 19.5 million. That's 0.088% of the entire population dead already. And with the daily deaths we're currently seeing in New York, it will take about 3 days before it passes 0.1%.

That's the COVID-19 mortality rate for the entire population of New York, which includes the uninfected.

So no, the IFR isn't "likely significantly under 0.1%".

I wrote a template for office workers temporarily working from home. Looking for the appropriate reddit sub to share it. Starting here, any advice?

TEMPLATE FOR SELF ADVOCACY
Good Morning ______,
First of all, I'd like to express my gratitude during this crazy time in the world for your willingness to adapt and heed caution regarding work-from-home advisements. It is important to me as an employee to honor that decision by being as productive in my remote workflow as I would at the office.

Regarding a return to normalcy‚Äîor as close as we'll get to it in the coming weeks/months‚ÄîI'd like to stay informed, or even be proactive in the development of what protocols will be in play to determine when and how we return to the office environment.

With so much conflicting information over the airwaves, I believe it's important for workers to understand the source and impetus behind advisements being followed to re-deploy. My hope is that workers follow guidelines based on a consensus from the medical community, and not be forced to put themselves and their families at risk due to an errant decision based on a network newscast or a strong day on Wall Street.

I, of course, am not asserting where your decision would be coming from, I am simply advocating for myself to be informed‚Äîand volunteering to help where warranted.

What are your thoughts?

As a man of few words, preferring passion and belief as a shield to be carried out upon, I am bemused to careless and reckless dialogue for no other purpose than to make myself heard among the masses plagued by willful ignorance. However, this is an appropriate, and even required tone for the head of the employees to adress the pleb with.

Surveys carried out by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya shows the death rate of the Corona virus is about par with the flu (0.1%)

Too early for any studies, on the flip side there is evidence of long term lung damage, infertility, even acquired immune deficiency (kind of like AIDS). This virus has elements of HIV and SARS in it. Do not compare it with the flu. People have not been able to clear it out of their systems for up to 60 days. This is not the flu.

The overall death rate might well be exactly that. But if so, we also need an explanation for why it hits certain places like a blowtorch. We can't afford a New York outcome in every big city.

0.1% death rate spread evenly and predictably is one thing. 0.1% death rate concentrated in a few places suggests the threat level is somehow higher than the current numbers might indicate.

Yes that's what I thought. I've had lots of colds and the flu a few times and I usually get really similar symptoms... This one was different, really nasty, symptoms I haven't had before (like struggling to breathe at night)... And then a couple of weeks later I start hearing about COVID-19.

I understand it's really unlikely given the timing and location, but it seems really coincidental.

I'm not going to brainlessly downvote.

I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen, this could be very well the worst worldwide catastrophe since WWII if it isn't already.

Businesses can't be closed for such long time until they make a vaccine if ever, this will result in a total societal collapse.

And opening up the economy again will without a doubt cause too many cases which no health system can cope with, resulting in tens of millions of deaths eventually.

So it's a bit of a pickle. Whatever governments choose, people will die in huge numbers. I don't think most people understand the gravity of the situation tbh, this is unprecedented.

What if the choice was whether or not you'd lose your house which you live in with your wife and three kids? Saying this only affects stock portfolios is extremely misguided and kind of telling in the amount of privilege you have

There are so many versions of the common cold its impossible to get a vaccine for all of them. And for the most part besides SARS, they're pretty harmless so there is little reason to rush them. They were working on a SARS one but since SARS is gone, no reason to rush. They know more or less how to do it, but now they have a specific strain to target. Much easier to do this when you're focused on one enemy.

We aren't all going to die from this. yes, does Sweden cast some doubt whether lockdown was a better option than just going to herd immunity, but it was probably the right call based on experience.

We don't do this every flu season, and honestly if that redmsiver trial actually works, if you get the mortality rate down to that of say the flu, this is over

well to me thats what it looks like - the choice is ruin the economy and die or save the economy and die. looks like we picked the latter....which is scary enough by itself because we dont have the safety measures in place yet for this kind of opening.....the virus doesnt give a shit about safety precautions humans are taking.....

Countries who order from unauthorized sellers may get defective products. Sorry I can‚Äôt help out with this brand. I cannot say for sure if it‚Äôs an authorized brand by China.

People generally are, our mobility ratings according to data from companies like city mapper and Google have dropped faster compared to many other places. However the lack of PPE in hospitals is certainly not helping, and not everyone is wearing masks in public. Plus our cities are extremely densely populated meaning that as much as you may try to social distance on the street, it's not physically possible in the supermarket, making the lack of mask wearing by some people an even bigger problem

Unfortunately you can't totally eliminate the virus. The best a lockdown can do is slow the spread of the virus and somewhat keep it under control which seems to be working in Spain i mean their numbers aren't rising as high as it was 2/3 weeks ago.

here is a good street level example. 2 people bring CV into a pork plant where they work side by side, and change in small changing room. the state has not protocols or restrictions. so those two infect 2 each on monday. so that is 6 infected on Monday. it needs a couple of days to incubate, but say by Friday the newly infected can infect 2 each plus the ordinal infected are still contagious so in 4 days you have 10 and it quickly cascades from there so by 3 weeks you have 600. the plant is closed and those 600 go home, or fishing, or hunting or drinking cause the state has no stay at home rules.

viola you have pandemic.

works on any scale and along any timeline short of say 4 weeks. if infected SD then the infection doesn't spread. if they minimally SD then is spread more slowly to less people.

Such measures would kill many more people than the virus would if we did absolutely nothing. Tens of millions would die in the developing world. Tens or hundreds of thousands in the developed world. Why do people dream off such totalitarian regimes to take power?

The professor has found common genome sequence and therefore thinks it‚Äôs man made. I‚Äôve read (I‚Äôll try to find the source) that the common sequence is short and can be found in 15 others viruses.

To me he jumped to the conclusion without proving it.

It may not be a narrative you want to hear. But with my relationship right there in Hong Kong, China is not warm and fuzzy. And their wonderful information to the public in China was ‚ÄúSteam masks‚Äù. And the talk about the lab there was forbidden. Stick your head in the sand left or right, it was from the lab. Infraction after infraction. Should have been shit down awhile ago.

Forbes is pushing a narrative? Really? https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/04/14/the-washington-post-goes-rogue-china-lab-in-focus-of-coronavirus-outbreak/

Actual doctors and surgeons? Saying what is medically necessary for patients?

https://aapsonline.org/covid-19-who-has-blood-on-his-hands/

Comon. Reddit used to be a place of discussion about facts. Not a vote down because someone hates the narrative. Reddit has been bombarded with ads from special interest groups and popular high karma accounts have been paid to state their popular opinions, not facts. So grab the usual narrative if you wish it isn‚Äôt going to change what actually is happening.

The original post you made was claiming the virus was manufactured. There is irrefutable evidence based on genetic analysis that this is not the case.

Wether it was under study in the Wuhan lab and leaked, is another matter. So far there is no way to know because China destroyed so much of the original samples taken and no evidence provided to back their claim of it being from the Wuhan market.

I'm not choosing a narrative to believe. I'm reading reliable sources and understanding that if any story starts with claiming it refutes 'mainstream media', it should be treated with a high degree of suspicion of its journalistic rigor.

Hospitals can do a lot more than just ventilation. Giving IV fluids is very helpful for those who are dehydrated and/or can't keep liquids down. Antibiotics prevent opportunistic infections like pneumonia. Some patients respond to oxygen without ventilation. And so on. Only the very worst cases go on a ventilator.

Rights aren't rights if they are taken away. Is this how we want to live our lives in this country? Afraid of every little thing. No one has stood up to question if shutting down the entire world by threat of fines and imprisonment is the right thing to do. I do not believe it is. The way I see it is that people have been frightened into submission. We ought to protest this and go about conducting business as usual. Allow and support those who choose to stay home voluntarily, but this country is looking like a totalitarian state more and more.

Thank God some states are reopening soon

The virus mortality rate is like 5% in the US and most of the people who died from it are elderly or people with an ongoing medical problem. These people should stay at home but other healthy people should start working soon. Orelse we won't die from the virus but will die from starvation. Hopefully, America can set a great example to the world and reopen Australia soon too

The mortality rate is probably closer to 1% if you try to account for untested cases as well.

sorry for the late response. Those nazis are downvoting like crazy just because people dont want to rot at home and starve to death

I am currently living in Melbourne and it is terrible, the Government is going crazy and keep giving fines out to anyone who they suspect had broken the 'social distance' rule. The death rate in Australia is even lower than than the US (1% I guess) and they are talking about locking down for 4 more f***ing weeks. Some of my friends already lost their job and the money they got from the Government is not going to be enough to sustain 4 more weeks+weeks after lockdown when they need to find a new job. Some friends even have 2-3 kids to feed so I don't even know how can they feed them if the lockdown continues. Eventually, people will not die from the virus but from starvation and homelessness (It is winter time soon in Australia so prepare for news that people died on the street because of Hypothermia after they were kicked out from their house.)

Edit: people who downvote this, are you going to donate money to my friends who are suffering from losing their jobs? Are you going to pay for their rent?

Australia has a moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent due to a loss of income because of coronavirus. Nobody is being made homeless. The government has doubled the unemployment benefit for all Australians including the newly unemployed. Nobody is being left to starve. I don't know if you are an Australian citizen but your information is wrong.

The new rule of eviction is implemented in different time state by state and even then there were confusion causing people getting kicked out anyway. There were tenants got evicted before the rule is implemented in Victoria https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/landlords-rush-to-throw-out-tenants-in-eviction-ban-confusion-20200408-p54idq.html

What about people who bought the house? Tell the bank to give you a year time to repay the mortgage?

What about people whose least is ended and need to find a new place? No inspection is allowed these days and no chance you can get a new place without inspection

Now everyone an Australian. What about those who are unde working visa? Working holiday visa? New Zealander? What can they do besides starving to death?

Stop over exaggerating the virus and reopen the economy. You guys can can always stay at mom‚Äôs basement as always but let people go back to work and feed themselves and their families

To answer your points:

People were being evicted for all sorts of reasons before the coronavirus and these evictions needed to be completed before any new rules came in. Landlords do not throw out good tenants for no reason.

People who have a mortgage but no mortgage insurance can get their mortgage payments deferred for 3 months at a time which can be extended for up to a year. There are hardship clauses in every mortgage that make it simple to put a hold on payments.

Tenants whose leases expire become month to month tenants. Some states, such as Queensland, have an automatic 6 month extension to all leases that expire before September. When a tenant has moved out an inspection an be done because the house is empty. It is only periodic inspections that have been halted.

Everyone who is not an Australian citizen is a citizen of another country. Every non-citizen was encouraged to return to their home country and was told they would not qualify for special unemployment payments because they were not citizens. Any non-citizen choosing to remain in Australia knew what they were getting into.

This virus is in 210 countries, yet 24% of the deaths are in the US. What exactly have we gotten right up until this point?

Hahaha. Half of those inbreds probably have it now. They also blocked the entrance to a hospital. So an ambulance had to wait outside. This is what happens when your town doesn‚Äôt fund basic science education.

Source? I've seen many sources disputing that this happened.

Also they're not disputing science, they're rallying against the unconstitutional overreach of their idiot governor.

You mean other than the people who are too poor to own cars, the people who are too poor to own standalone houses and instead live in high occupancy dwellings, and the people who live in major cities where distancing in normal.times is all but impossible.

Interesting how all three of these go together in major metro

People will always vote for someone you don't like. Trump got elected and he ran the country into the ground, totally bumbled the pandemic response and now thousands are dying on a daily basis. All because he had a hunch it was a hoax.

And people are still planning to vote for him again. Why not just let him into your house to butt f*** you and your whole family at this point.

Everyone keeps saying stay home. I‚Äôm carrying on as ‚Äùnormal‚Äú, here‚Äôs why:

I live in my own home by myself. My only friend refuses to go out because they are living with their grandmother. Therefore, I have nobody To socialize with in person.

Everybody at work is either working from home or was fired/furloughed. My work desk is in an isolated, empty room that‚Äôs about 25 yards long. I see absolutely nobody in an 8 hour day.

The only thing I am touching outside of my home is my car, the front door to work (with gloves and disinfectant every time), the work bathroom (again, with gloves and disinfectant every time, and washing my hands thoroughly). My work computer (which nobody else touches or comes into contact with), gas pumps (with gloves and disinfectant), and my mail (which I spray with disinfectant and leave in the sun). I have enough food for months, so I haven‚Äôt needed to go to the grocery store since early March.

I have nobody to rely on except for myself. If going into work helps me to provide for myself, and I am being vigilant about not putting others at risk, then there is nothing wrong with me going to work every day as I normally would. I was already living a very isolated lifestyle. With very little adjustments, I‚Äôve been able to continue my normal routine.

Everyone‚Äòs situation is different. I‚Äôm not going to put my livelihood at risk by not going into work when my normal routine is already extremely isolated. Yeah, I get it; If I was around other people a lot, or in a place where I was touching a bunch of shared surfaces, then it would make sense to stay at home. As it is, it would be foolish of me to put my job, my income, and my health insurance at risk. I‚Äôm lucky to still have a job and to be in good health. for me, staying at home would lead to far greater consequences than if I just continue with my routine.

They have an erratic leader that changes his mind everyday.

They are leaving the NY and CA peak. Since that‚Äôs most of the population that‚Äôs not too bad.

It‚Äôs bullshit for now. The CDC has been assisting China in improving their infectious disease testing capability.

What if the government gave all the people who are still able to work the opportunity to donate percentage points of our checks until those who aren't able to work are able to receive an equal percent of their paychecks? Example: working donate 5% until unemployed receive 95% of theirs
