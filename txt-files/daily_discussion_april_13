Perhaps it’s just an issue of random grouping, but I’m starting to notice a lot of pandemic articles starting to use the past tense in their headlines. “What went wrong…“, “Lessons learned…“, etc.

I think this reflects potential waning social stamina about this whole thing. The teeming millions can only remain engaged at a heightened level for so long.

I read an interesting article a couple weeks ago about the three major stages people would go through in dealing with this crisis.

The first stage is denial; people refuse to believe that it could possibly be as bad as experts are saying. The result of that is a cavalier 'oh, it can't affect me, they are overreacting!' attitude, with jokes and disbelief coloring the conversation, and no behavioral changes.

The second stage happens after people they know (or famous people) start to get sick and die. Then their attitude shifts to fiercely controlling their personal situation: hoarding groceries, fanatically cleaning their homes, and doing everything possible to maintain some sense of normalcy to their changing situation.

The third stage is the most dangerous one, and it's definitely happening now in Portland, OR as well as elsewhere: an overreaction and vocal celebration of any good news as the new overall trend. This often to the point of being very upset with anyone who dares to question their new over the top optimism. This ultimately leads to people relaxing their vigilance in hygiene and their tendency to think the worst of it has passed. Which in turn leads to a more severe second wave outbreak of the disease.

Interesting to see it all unfold exactly as described.

I'm just seeing a lot of people here lately who are seizing on our recent numeric 'plateau' as proof that this will all be over with in a few weeks. It's just not that simple, and promoting 'the worst is over!' as an idea is dangerous at this early juncture. We aren't doing nearly enough testing in Oregon at this point to make that leap.

I get that people are under stress and want to enjoy good news, and that's fine. But when you start changing and relaxing your behavior it gets a bit sketchy again.

This is also happening in the southern parts of Virginia where testing is limited. People are claiming that there isn’t enough data to prove that deaths are specifically due to COVID-19. For example, citing that someone that dies of a heart attack and was postmortem tested for COVID-19, the death is logged as a coronavirus death.

I’m already less engaged. It hasn’t really hit here. I stay home, but I don’t watch the news daily. It looks like forcing us all home puts the country on a pretty stable plateau of 30,000 new cases everyday. Those cases are spread more around the country, but the plateau is not decreasing. I think you’re right. More people are going to get fed up and just show up at the hardware/grocery store just for something to do.

Containment measures like stay at home orders are actually effective to slow the growth. Problem is that you can't do it indefinitely, people are getting impatient. Once you open up you're back to exponential growth.

It’s a very real thing. By nature or (life traumas, low dopamine, etc) I tend to handle emergent events very well.

For the first week of this I felt like a rockstar. I knew what needed to be done, and did it. Made multiple levels of plans, handled all my work stuff too and even prepped the house for impending quarantine. I was more functional that first week than I have been in years.

After a week though? I was shot. I ran out of stamina. The anxiety creeped back in, and the depression, and I’ve become a useless wreck. It’s definitely a real thing.

I was the same way. Locked and loaded that first week (going on week five right now). And now I’m just doing my best not to slip into a depression. I don’t really see the benefit in calling a mental health line...what are they going to tell me? I’m just trying to do what I need to do to keep my head above water at work.

I agree, and I'm getting nervous that here in the US its bolstered by numbers that just dont seem right... I think people eager to see this end + lack of reliable testing = false hope in waning new infection rates.

Generally speaking, 40% to 50% of patients with severe respiratory distress die while on ventilators, experts say. But 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines in New York City have died, state and city officials say.

80% seems to be true for Italy as well, but some reports from Germany quoted COVID ventilation survival closer to 50%. As far as I can tell, if an area's healthcare system is coping well with the crisis, then people get ventilators when they need them, and do better as a result. If the cases spike and the system becomes overwhelmed, people have to wait longer and get sicker before they would qualify for ventilators and is more likely to die even when they get there. My hospital in Canada has adopted the 'intubate earlier and more aggresively' approach for Covid patients, I hope they are right. Hopefully more data would come in soon.

See I’d agree with that assessment if it didn’t already state that it was the 80% of those already on ventilators. As you stated, more research is certainly needed.

If this is causing more harm than good that information needs to be brought to light. Additionally, if Germany is reporting differently, are there procedures they’re following that Italy and New York are not?

I don't know about Germany's procedures but ours right now is to intubate as soon as the patient begin to de-stabilize. If Germany is doing the same, it would make sense that more of them survived ventilators, in the sense that more of them would have survived regardless.

There are the people who definitely need ventilators, in the sense that they will die within minutes without one, and people who definitely don't, like those whose oxygen level is ok, but what do we do with those who fall into the middle zone of uncertainty? Is it better to intubate them early, or wait for them to get closer to death first? How on earth do we find an ethical way to study that properly? "Please sign here to agree to this research, if you need a code blue, we will flip a coin and decide whether to intubate you or not."

I hope to god that ours is the correct approach, because if it's true that those people are actually better off without ventilators, then we are f***ing up as we speak.

During lockdown "underwear" should be referred to as "first pants," so that when someone asks you during a zoom meeting whether you have pants on, you can honestly say "yes." Discuss.

I work for a company who provides software in a lot of corporate environments, airports, hospitals, universities, etc. Today out of curiosity I checked the single day year over year sales for a couple of our largest customers. I looked at the first Monday in April for 2019 and 2020.

Customer 1 April 1, 2019 sales: $3.5 million. April 6, 2020 sales: $665 thousand.

Customer 2 April 1, 2019 sales: $2 million April 6, 2020 sales: $58.5 thousand

In no way do I wish to understate the horror of the cost of human life this virus is causing. But I'm also very concerned for the long term financial impacts of all this.

There's a tendency to oversimplify by some people posting here. "No deaths for corporate profits!" is some exciting sloganism... but if the economy completely collapses, there will be many deaths as a result. The calculation of loss of life from economic downturns has been extensively studied and is considered normal science.

Some may counter that we need a new economic system that transcends this. Okay, fine... but the mechanics of such a system have not been established and we are sort of stuck with the system we have.

As such, the false dilemma of "lives" vs. "economics" really needs to be throttled. These are interrelated things...

I agree. In my opinion in the short term the surest aid would be to get money in the hands of people ASAP. This would then be spent on rent, utilities, necessities and in some cases entertainment, boosting the economy. It would help mitigate the non-illness related suffering that has already started and will get worse as this continues on

On a smaller but relevant scale, a friend has a restaurant that has to remain closed now, for no one knows how long. Their landlord has only offered to cut the rent by half during this period, which is still many thousands. If the lockdowns keep going, so many businesses like his will just have to shut down.

The worst part is that a lot of owners leveraged their homes to get a loan for the business where the husband and wife both work. And now they’re losing their business, career, and home all at the same time.

I am a young attorney (personal injury) in NJ who makes roughly 100,000 per year. We have 9 attorneys and about 15 support staff. Business has been very good to say the least.

Due to COVID, governor Murphy shut down pretty much the entire state including the court system making my role pretty much useless since I’m the one Who goes to the conferences and argues motions and all that.

And even if we settle cases outside of court the insurance companies don’t have the support staff in the building anymore to process checks so there’s little to no money coming in.

So my boss basically shut down the firm With about 75% of the employees being furloughed. It’s basically the three partners and their secretaries as a skeleton crew.

Now I’m on unemployment for the foreseeable future and while New Jersey is quite generous 713 per week plus 600 from the fed, I’m still down although I won’t be struggling.

Fortunately since everything is closed the amount I spend going out on weekends is zero plus Its not taxed like regular income so it’s a negligible loss (for me) but this can’t go on forever.

But it's not the lock-down that's killing business, it's the virus. Even in countries that did not lock down, like Sweden, business is down to 10-20% of normal. If we don't get the virus under control first, lifting the lock-down will make things worse for businesses, not better.

Most experts believe that a harsher lock-down that can control the spread would be better for the economy than a more lenient one that drags the spread on and on. https://www.ft.com/content/e593e7d4-b82a-4bf9-8497-426eee43bcbc

There is no lockdown that stamps the virus down to zero, and even one case can restart exponential growth again.

The only endpoint of this is herd immunity. Either naturally or through a vaccine. Since a vaccine will take a year, at least, what you're calling for is a year of lockdowns.

Since that is not possible, what we're doing is some short term lockdowns while we increase hospital capacity. Thos will have to end in the next month or you'll get irreperable breakdown to the economic engine.

But the idea that that there's some outcome other than most everyone geting the virus or everyone gets a vaccine...that doesn't exist.

That’s what Reddit doesn’t understand. There is only one outcome that is going to happen here. They will reopen the country and hope for herd immunity and people will die.

It’s some harsh truths that this sub doesn’t want to face.

It’s sucks but that is the only option. Short of locking down the country for a year in the hopes we can develop a vaccine by then if ever.

There is no magical third option.

Yes there is a third option, and to state otherwise is to be a f***ing liar or not paying attention. You test, you force masks, and you trace localized outbreaks. You have a government response that actually constantly updates its guidelines on travel, etc based on what data shows. In otherwords YOU CONTAIN, which is what we should have done in the first place, but we completely wasted our time.

Getting cases back down to near zero is about allowing containment, like we should have had in the first round.

The other 2 roads only lead to calamity, especially opening things back up without a plan in place. It own't be 200k that die, it will be a clusterf*** of broken hospitals around the country. It will be unfathomable.

Ah yes. The option that still would be many months away if even possible. We can’t even get masks to our hospitals and you want everyone to have an N95 for everyday of the week because that’s what it would take to be effective. In the meantime we spend another 4 months in lockdown and unemployment balloons to 50m and we have riots.

Pump those breaks. We live in a reality not a fantasy land.

Thoughts on things that are going to permanently change?

I don't see all the toll booth operators being rehired in states that have replaced them with automated systems.

The expansion of telemedicine is going to change a lot of future health appointments.

I think it will be a while before bars and restaurants return to pre-covid levels. People will be eager to get back, but they're forming new habits and routines and people are creatures of habit.

I don't think I can fully imagine how the next year will look like. Everything is a guessing game for me at this point, it's really hard to predict things. I think nothing major will change after we come back to normal, but that will not be before a year or two go by. That's a really long time period to be in this shitty semi-normal state. On top of that, I think this will swing a lot. We have to reopen, that will cause more cases, we'll then have to close more, that will cause panic buying again. I hope I'm wrong, but I think we're in for a long shit ride with this one.

Our doctors are through Cleveland clinic and they were already using telemedicine but I do think this will get more people used to it who otherwise wouldn't have given it a try. I do wonder about the movie industry. Maybe it'll scale down theaters because now people might like that they can get movies direct to home sooner. Also curbside and delivery for groceries: was already expanding but will probably explode and get even more business.

In Brazil our situation is so bad. People are in the streets protesting against the Ministry of Health that are doing a great job. I'm really afraid because the numbers are underestimated taking into account that we have just 200 text for 1 million.

Not too much, but the reports says that 50% of people are staying at home, which is a way down what the state governor says it's needed, to avoid hospital overflow, which is about 70% of people satying at home.

Here we basically have two situations, the president want the people on the street, to avoid the economy burndown, and the state govern whant people to stay at home, to avoid hospital overflow. The health minister is doing a great job, but I think, as far as I understand, that he will be fired this week, it's very close to what US is facing right now, as far as I understoo.

The president is worried because he knows that the only chance to be relected is the economy get better. Considering the actual circunstances there's no way to it happen. To accomplish his objectives he can do everything, including acting like there's no virus in the country and put all lives in risk.

I don't believe that Mandetta will be fired. A recent report says that Bolsonaro has lost his power as president and who are leading the country is a summit of high-ranking military.

Happy Monday all. Please consider supporting the food bank and other like organizations. They are in desperate need. You can donate to the organization OR your local food bank. They accept food and monetary donations. Donate at: https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank

Coronavirus has resulted in an unprecedented need for food that the food banks are I'll prepared for. In the meantime, food costs are increasing while food donations are decreasing. This pandemic is a tragedy but let us triumph in the darkness. More detailed info on the need can be found here: https://lettersontextualspaghettification.com/2020/04/11/aneasterplea/

I really appreciate you posting this, thank you! I just came from my local food bank, the line is at least 3 times longer this week and now goes into the next block. They were rationing out even less, I didn't stick around but I'm worried they are going to be turning away some people today with the little they had.

I implore you, if you can donate to your local food bank, please do, they need your support now more than ever. I'm in Chicago so if you want to donate to ours specifically, you can do so here: https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/financial-support/

Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you can please spread the word. Stay safe and take care all <3

My mother in law has an autoimmune disorder and a rare lung disease and some other family members decided to just come visit her recently?? Two essential workers and two teenagers who bounce between two households due to having divorced parents.

It scares the shit to of me that they're risking my mother in laws life. It's obviously also a problem that she allowed them to come visit. My mother in law is a very smart person and retired medical assistant so i'm sure she understands she is at risk but she's also very stubborn about being independent and so on so I assume she allowed it because she doesn't want to appear fragile or whatever....but she IS.

Anyway. Does anyone have good resources to videos that quickly and effectively explain the basics of this stuff, like why it's risky to visit even if everyone feels okay, why it's risky to be around people who have been around people you haven't been around, etc? I realize the odds of getting through to these people are low but I feel like I have to try because this could be a life/death thing.

with all due respect, all least for your MIL, it doesn't seem like she needs the education, she's a medical professional, she knows, she just chooses to act otherwise. I think you can share your feelings with her but in the end, she has to decide her risk level. I wish you the best and her. Sorry she does not see it your way :(

I have been wondering for days, how can I help?

I have a vehicle and love to drive. I want to know if there is a way in which I can help. Like, maybe transporting smaller equipment, or taking food for nurses and doctors, or whatever really.

I would just volunteer myself in a medical facility, but I do not live by myself, so I am trying to be mindful of not only my safety, but those around me.

Anyone has any resources or volunteer organizations needing assistance in the DC (US) area?

Currently reading John M. Barry's 2004 book "The Great Influenza — The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History." Timely, yes? Said to be the best account of the 1918 pandemic. Much of it rings eery bells - deserted cities, exhausted nurses, one solitary carrier spreading the virus wherever they went. But my God, the symptoms were horrific: bodies turned blue-black or oozing from every orifice, corpses stacked like cordwood, ribs breaking from coughing. COVID-19 isn't anything near as vicious; and thankfully we know so much more now. It took years just to confirm that the 1918 flu was a virus, not a bacterium. So - good reading, very in depth. His introductory chapters about the backwards state of American medicine in most of the 19th century are fascinating, too.

I think by the summer so June-ish we will see things returning to semi normality. Schools will likely start on schedule for august and September. Restraunts and other businesses will likely be open by June as well, as they need to open up to prevent them from going out of business.

That's true. I just got facebook back after not having it for years. Mainly to be in a messenger group with my family but then I added people and that was a mistake.

Most of my friends are from when I was in minstry school and very conservative which I have been for years, but lately I'm ashamed after seeing what a majority (not all) of my friends post and say about certain topics. I cant even remotely align their beliefs with the teachings of Jesus, and then to say our economy is more important than the deaths of this virus? I'm just at a loss for words.

No.

Flattening the curve only buys time for the medical system to prepare, so more can recieve ideal treatment, which can reduce the mortality.

Herd immunity requires 80% infected, which would be about 1-2 million dead, even with a prepared healthcare system. This is not an acceptable end game to most people.

Waiting for a vaccine with full lockdown for 1-2 years would have an unacceptable economic cost.

Therefore, the goal is to (1) start with aggressive lockdown to flatten the curve, letting healthcare systems prepare. (2) Have massive testing to identify who is protected. (3) Let the recovered return to work. (4) Continue to test and trace contacts on a massive scale so local hotspots can be shut down before they grow out of control.

Only a tiny fraction of the population is currently recovered, so massive testing to find them isn't enough to send people back to work. The virus is around 1.0% fatal, which means for every 100 recovered people there is 1 who died.... so a million would die to get everyone back to work.

That's why there is no easy way out. Either we (1) let a huge number of people die, (2) protect everyone and suffer a 1-2 year economic disaster, or (3) accept a massive loss of personal privacy by accepting ongoing widespread mandated government tracking, tracing, and adaptive quarantines.

All of those are unappealing to me, but we shouldn't fool ourselves that there's a miracle cure or vaccine that will get here in time, and we shouldn't believe people who tell us what we can reopen the economy without cost now that we've flattened the curve. Our current situation is to choose two: Life, Liberty, or The Pursuit of Happiness...

Projected timelines for a functional vaccine at minimum is two years from discovery to commercial readiness and mass immunization. Vaccines take a long time to test because scientists need to be sure there are no negative long term effects.

Yeah, this -- when you're considering a treatment for someone who is sick with something that might kill them, it's one thing to be cavalier about long-term negative effects. Cause it's probably better than being dead.

But if we're talking about a vaccine that 80%+ of all humankind is going to receive as soon as possible, you want to make damn sure there aren't any long term health consequences for that.

So glad my landlord is insisting on showing the house

This is my dilemma. I want to sell my condo, but I want to be considerate of my excellent tenants. So far I've been unable to decide to put the condo on the market.

Suggest to your landlord that his real estate broker create a video tour of your house. A realtor offered me that option as a way to reduce showings.

I suggested to that realtor, that when a serious qualified buyer insists on an on-site tour before buying -- which is totally reasonable -- the buyer pays $500 for the privilege. That would cut out casual shoppers. I would take the $500 off the next month's rent, to compensate my tenants for enduring the risk. $500 is nothing to someone who is serious about buying the house; typical closing costs are several thousand dollars. I would reimburse the $500 to the buyer if the buyer BUYS.

What do you think of that idea? Would you be happier about showings if you were compensated $$$ for each one?

If you like the idea, you could try to get your landlord to adopt the video tour + $500 (or whatever) charge policy -- by promising to leave the place a complete mess whenever a showing is scheduled. Get creative. Put a "out of order" sign on the washing machine. Cook fish and cabbage so the place smells rank. Don't flush the toilet after a huge dump and disconnect the handle from the workings in the tank, so the realtor can't easily flush it away. After ONE disastrous showing your landlord might be inclined to adopt the policy.

My realtor didn't like the idea of charging for showings. "You want as many people as possible looking at the property. I've never heard of anyone charging to view a property." These are weird times, though. Prospective buyers should get the problem, IMO. If I decide to put my condo on the market and that realtor won't accept the pay-to-view idea, I'll find another who does. Maybe I won't get top dollar, but I'll minimize the likelihood of making my tenants sick. I'd feel like as asshole for the rest of my life if showings led to one of my tenants dying.

It goes without saying that you are elsewhere during showings, and you wipe the place down afterward, right?

Good luck to you!

April 13 Updates

Incorporated April 12 data

Cumulative positive percentage (CPP) increased from 19.6% to 19.7%

Overall trend continues

The plateau in new cases per day (around 30,000) seems to be limited by how many tests are performed.

Simply put, if tests are limited to 150,000 with 20% positives a plateau is hit at 30,000 new cases a day.

The table below shows how this tracks with the last 14 days of US historical data on testing from https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily

The cumulative positive percentage (CPP) is calculated as the most recent Positive / Total Tests (551,826 / 2,805,892 = 19.7%).

Estimated Cases (Est Cases) is calculated as that day's New Tests x CPP.

The daily positive percentage (DPP) is calculated as that day's New Cases / New Tests and shows how consistently these two statistics are related.

This highlights the importance of widespread, large-scale testing. Without it:

New cases appear to plateau leading to a false sense of security

Deaths are undercounted due to undiagnosed cases

Projection models are less accurate (garbage in garbage out)

Nice summary. I don’t understanding pending cases - how are we still at 16k backlog with 150k new tests? Wouldn’t that backlog go away after 1 day?

Is the number of performed tests limited by the offer (number of tests available) or by the demand showing up for them (so demand in hospitals, mainly)?

One thing I’ve noticed is that people seem to not understand the difference between quarantining and social distancing.

You don’t need to lock yourself inside and hide there for the next three months. I am very curious to see how Sweden fares compared to the rest of the world as a model to follow moving forward.

I am starting to feel that covid has made an incredible impact on my life even though no one I know got infected with it. Before all that I used to think I am a very strong mental-wise individual and now after 1 month of self isolation I get anxiety from so many things, from reading about some young adults with no diseases whatsoever that got taken down by covid to simple events I planned out for my summer and seeing them getting cancelled one by one

I suspect that well adjusted people have fewer tools in their kits to deal with something like this. Try different things, you will find a good coping mechanisms that works for you eventually, and it's ok to be not ok. Take care

I think that´s normal, we all pretty much there at this point. I´m just trying to not focus on the distant future and try to take it week by week or so. In general we are lucky if we are not sick and if we can eat daily, have a house and stuff.

It’s amazing the change in commercials since the lockdown. Now there’s a company delivering dog food, a company delivering smoothies, and then all the online purchasing apps. I thought in store retail was in trouble before. Now the move to online purchasing is entering a sprint.

Not to mention the Mypillow slimeball who’s turned his WH appearance into a national media blitz during every commercial break.

Real talk. Is there a scenario where it makes sense to get sick intentionally, obviously after resource peaks pass in my area? I’m young, healthy, and in excellent shape and understand that’s not a shield but I have as good a chance as anyone does going into it. I would be able to self isolate completely for at least two weeks (unless I needed treatment of course).

Im in an essential public-facing position but I also want to be able to go back to caring for my elderly and immune-compromised parents as soon as possible once the first wave is over and otherwise I don’t know how I’m going to ever feel like I’m keeping their exposure through me minimal until there is a vaccine. I know having been sick doesn’t necessarily render you completely immune and it might still be possible to carry/spread it—there is just so much we don’t know—but I don’t know what the options are otherwise.

Sorry if this sounds crazy, just floating ideas out there.

Take a look at The COVID Challenge where you sign up to (maybe) deliberately and scientifically get infected with coronavirus, volunteers are trying to make a list of people who would be willing to get deliberately infected (if it came to that) in order to test vaccines, which they will hand over to vaccine-makers once they get to the testing stage. https://www.thecovidchallenge.org/

I've seen proposals floated that we should allow people who have gotten the virus and recovered be allowed to resume normal life (assuming they have antibodies that will give them immunity), so if that becomes a thing then I think your idea of lower risk people getting intentionally infected could become a thing. I'm not sure if it's a good idea at all, but I could see a future where you might actually be encouraged to do it.

The problem is that we don't know how long the immunity lasts, imagine isolating for 1 month and then losing immunity in 3 or 4 months.

That's the problem with this sub--people are buying into the idea that some short term lockdown will work or that a long term lockdown is at all feasible without a horrendous depressoin and likely violent social disorder.

Lockdowns won't work like that. Even one case leads right back to exponential growth. The only endpoint to this is herd immunity--naturally or through a vaccine. This is not my political opinion. This is a fact.

Best we can do is build up hospital capacity and treatment trials during this lockdown, which is happening. But the endpoint of lockdowns isn't stamping out the virus, and you can't extend them much longer before the economic engine breaks down irreparably.

Forecast for the New York State: https://imgur.com/gallery/bY7j3zS

Forecast for all 50 states: https://imgur.com/gallery/bt3Em6c

Some states, for example Kentucky, Delaware, New Mexico, South Carolina need to calm down and strengthen their measures.

This may seem optimistic, but there is no optimism in the calculation. The dynamics and the projection can be seen in the bottom right chart "Days to double". The method has been checked on the countries which has already passed the inflection point. The exponential growth may have both a surprisingly fast acceleration and surprisingly fast downfall as we can see from China and S. Korea. Each state may be on full or partial lock-down till there are no new inside cases. Therefore, there is a probability of min 2 months of social distending and no schools. Some states have already passed the inflection point or going to pass it in the next 2-3 days (ex. California, Florida).

I couldn't post to the actual reddit, so I'll put it here.
Throwaway to maintain privacy.

I worked in the pharmaceutical industry... keyword is worked. I was recently furloughed after having developed the covid-19 testing capabilities of a major pharmaceutical company in the United States.
(Focus in on serologically-determined immunity markers E.G. antibodies that show you have already recovered and can go back to work without fear)

What I do is not particularly difficult (at least, not an unreasonable effort for those with a formal biochemistry/chemistry background. Fairly straightforward). But after developing the tests, I was furloughed and told that it could be as long as July (more likely June 1) when my services would be needed again. Presumably, this is because a standardized testing SOP can be run much more cheaply by someone with less training who is willing to work for less.

I know that this was done because they company is hoping they can save costs by forcing the government to pay me a stipend to live rather than them having to eat the cost. There is no justifiable reason based on skills alone that I should be unemployed and it would be much better used on someone else.

Unfortunately, I have no other option as I was also told during a furlough exit interview that I have a non-compete clause. So I cannot help other companies that want to develop similar testing strategies or I would be subject to legal action.

I truly have no idea what to do from here. It makes me feel sick to my stomach that I can't contribute during a crisis that, for lack of a better phrase, I was uniquely built to address.

Washington Post:

Conservative groups mobilize to push White House to try to reopen economy

Multiple leading conservative advocacy groups plan to announce a joint coalition to demand the reopening of the U.S. economy despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, pushing for government authorities to loosen restrictions, against the warnings of leading public health experts, according to three people with knowledge of the coming announcement.

The push from conservative groups aims to put pressure on President Trump and the nation’s governors to relax stay-at-home orders and other measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus that threatens hundreds of thousands of American lives.

The outside effort from conservative groups is expected to be led by Stephen Moore, a conservative at the Heritage Foundation who is close with White House economic officials; Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots; Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy organization; and Lisa Nelson, chief executive of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization with ties to the Koch Brothers, according to the three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of an effort that had not been publicly revealed.

Faroes here: We are down to 21 currently infected, (out of a total of 184), last new infection happened on the 6th, so more than a week ago. Everyone who desires it gets tested, currently 11% of the population has been tested. So a few more days and we should be in the clear. And then hopefully everything opens up again and there will be a strickt quarantine for EVERYONE coming into the country.

If this happens again in China -- and history suggests it will (e.g. SARS) -- Europe and the U.S. must aggressively implement travel bans blocking all travel from China. This isn't just about protecting Europe and the U.S., but weaker health systems in Africa and Latin America, regions generally reached via travel through Europe and the U.S.

Concerned about xenophobia and "shutting down borders"? Okay, well, the failure of Europe and the U.S. to implement robust travel bans as quickly as Taiwan and Singapore has now led to the complete shutdown of globalization.

China needs to be put on notice: next time there's any evidence of a respiratory infection in a large Chinese city, travel will be banned from the entire country. This wouldn't push regular (innocent) Chinese people who don't travel much abroad, but would punish the elites who prop up the CCP and frequently travel to Europe, whether for tourism, education, or to reach second homes.

This is something that could perhaps be organized via NATO.

You have to block all travel not just travel from China.

The world is too interconnected for that As someone from China will have already infected someone from South Korea who infected someone from Japan who infected someone from Canada who infected someone from England and so on and so on and so on.

I have a question on regard of the coming vaccines.

Let's suppose they have a vaccination site in some months and people must go take the vaccines.

If there is a line of people to get a vaccine and one of them is infected with the virus, if someone not infected in the line gets infected by that person and then takes the vaccine, what would happen? Will the vaccine work faster or does it take too long to adapt and would be useless?

Depending on the viral load they would still get sick regardless of the vaccine. Vaccines are just viruses that have been "disabled" but still have the signature of the virus so the immune system knows how to fight it. If both the disabled vaccine version of the virus and the enabled wild version of the virus infect each other at near the same time the vaccine version hasn't had enough time to build the body's immune system

Forgive me if this is obvious, but I've been thinking about it.

Say you have a worker (e.g. a grocery store cashier) who has beaten the virus and is immune.. They can't infect others if they don't have it. However, since the virus can exist on surfaces, what's stopping the cashier from spreading it if they encountered the virus and touched other surfaces?

Why is Fauci saying now the projection is 60k deaths in the US when the projection is ~50k deaths by the end of this month, and then even if it'll slow down in May, June and later, it'll still be way more than 10k deaths after April.

It would be helpful for a lot of you to familiarize yourself with how other countries are handling this, Trump is not the most eager world leader when it comes to opening the economy back up, EU countries like Norway and The Netherlands will reopen before the USA does.

Wanting to reopen the economy is not an American thing at all at this point, it seems to be the global consensus.

I'm not sure how useful the examples you gave there were - I googled just now and found an article saying Netherlands were extending their lockdown to June, whereas Trump has been talking about the start of May.

And Norway (not an EU country btw) is getting around 10 deaths a day, they are at a completely different stage of the outbreak to the US, reopening in a couple of weeks might be reasonable for them in a way that it isn't for the US

uhhh what?

I live in the Netherlands and whilst we've never had a 'strict' lockdown (such as France), we have restrictions already until June 1st! I think why at least the rest of the World views Trump so poorly in this particular matter is that from the offset he was taking about reopening (filling the churches by Easter...)

Whilst i agree that yes all the world is interested in opening the economy, saying the Netherlands is opening soon is fake information! Also remember that this virus hit Europe before the US.

Ah, but the key is having enough of a mitgation plan in place for when you do reopen. So far the US has no sensible idea of how to do this.

A lot of people rn are saying our government has not acted swiftly enough and because of that we have a lack of supplies and overcrowded hospitals. The United States has by far the most cases with 562,000 at the moment with 22,000 deaths which is a high number. Spain has 169,000 cases which is 2nd and has over 17,000 deaths. The US’s death rate is much lower than Spain or Italy’s. I just wanted to point that out. We have 5x as many cases but a substantially lower mortality rate. If the us had the same amount of people as Spain we would have about a third of the deaths Spain has at the moment.

I think the lower death rate may also have to do with Italy and Spain having much older populations and more multi-generational living situations. More old people + more old people living with young people who are still going out/working = more deaths.

I know this will get me downvoted to shit because AMERICA = BAD but we truly do have some of the best hospitals in the entire world in this country, along with amazing research colleges and medical professionals. Like holy shit did NYC’s hospital system do an incredible job handling this disaster. I also think treatment has improved over the past month or so, resulting in less deaths.

"Speaking at a White House briefing on March 9, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told the world that “if you are a healthy young person, there is no reason if you want to go on a cruise ship, to not go on a cruise ship.”

He went on to say that “if you have … an individual who has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person who has an underlying condition, I would recommend strongly that they do not go on a cruise ship.”"

This will be a roller-coaster for the next year or so. Reopening countries will be hard, possibility of 2nd and 3rd waves with the closures they bring, depression, homelessness, bankruptcies, increase in crime, etc.

I think we'll all go through one form or another of all these. I really wish none of these come true...

Seems to me like world leaders have access to some data or info that suggests quarantines can be eased soon, I know it’s tempting to feel like an expert because you can post Reddit comments but throughout this process there’s clearly been a lot of information government leaders have had access to that’s never been released publicly, that’s why they’ve been making decisions which didn’t totally seem to line up with their country’s current situation according to the information available to us

Does is seem unfair that the US is primarily blamed for downplaying the virus, but yet there are still countries and Continents that don't even acknowledge it's existence? Why does everyone think the US failed to act in late January when the only source of information on the virus was coming from China (who were also downplaying the virus significantly)? I agree the US was late to jump on the pandemic bandwagon but it just feels like every other country that failed to act is in the shadow of the US (one of the first to put in place travel restrictions from Europe).

I think people had higher expectations for the US. In 2019, the Johns Hopkins study ranked the US as first in the world in being well prepared for a pandemic, which seems really sad now. As far as I can tell, the US had great plans, and didn’t follow any of them.

Our big brained President continually and publicly denied it was a problem and even mocked people for taking it seriously up until it had already taken a foothold. We had the infrastructure to do something about the virus sooner and we didn't.

Are there other countries out there that haven't handled this well? Of course. But we're supposed to be the greatest and most powerful nation in the world and we did nothing to mitigate this earlier when we could have. Of course we're going to get a lot of blame and focus.

Three major stages-I think you just described me but I am at the point that I just go with the flow. I have excepted our new normal and I am okay with it for now. After all, it is not forever. I will wait until the government gives us the green light to be back to normal. Then our children can return to school and we can go to work and life will be good once again.

In the US, question about the $1200 stimulus. I've looked everywhere with no real answer. If you are currently receiving unemployment benefits and will soon be receiving the additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits from the federal government, are you still eligible for the $1200 stimulus? Or is the stimulus for those that are not unemployed -as in, if you are unemployed you can't double dip and get the $1200 stimulus AND the $600 weekly?

The $1200 checks are completely independent of whatever your employment situation is. Everyone under 75k a year is getting the 1200, whether they've lost their job or not. If you're also getting unemployment, you'll get that extra $600/month for the next 4 months, ON TOP OF the 1200 that everyone under 75k is getting.

Has anyone else heard people claiming that this is all just a farce? I'm from a rural area so we are pretty sheltered but I've heard some people claiming that the media/government is just calling all deaths from pneumonia or the flu COVID-19 fatalities to rev up panic. I don't believe this but I guess I would like to hear you guy's thoughts on it. The amount of misinformation that is floating around is one of the most surprising aspects of this pandemic in my opinion especially in the early stages it was hard to know what was true...

Well the link to the data is in the image, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/data/NCHSData13.csv

A quick look and it seems accurate to that data but it seems to take it out of context.

I checked for the next weeks data by adding 1 to the number, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/data/NCHSData14.csv

A quick look there makes it very obvious that these are not final numbers and the numbers are adjusted over the following weeks, presumably as more data is verified.

The numbers for weeks 1-12 for this year were adjusted up by the below since the original charts data,

1	72
2	90
3	151
4	215
5	382
6	594
7	863
8	905
9	886
10	1485
11	3130
12	8486
So that "big dip" is now 48488 and if we assume a similiar history for the week compared to the others this year, it'll get another 8,000+ added over the next several weeks, bringing the total over 56k when all is said and done.

If you look where 56k would be on the chart, it would actually be a very sharp incline upwards from the trend leading up to that point for the year.

So yea, this is a good example of twisting facts to fit an agenda by taking non-final numbers out of context. The same types who pretended "only 100 people have died the flu is way worse!" weeks ago

Sunday and Monday are when the dip is recorded from the Saturday Sunday dip. Tuesday is when we see the bump usually. The dip is usually not this deep and usually wouldn't have been seen in Friday/Saturday reporting so there is reason for some hopeful optimism. Too early yet to say for certain. Way too early yet to say skepticism is unwarranted.

Half of EU coronavirus deaths happened in nursing homes. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/half-of-coronavirus-deaths-happen-in-care-homes-data-from-eu-suggests?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_b-gdnnews&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1586780662

Let me repeat: half of EU coronavirus deaths happened in nursing homes.

Does it make sense to continue single-mindedly focusing on "lockdowns" when the majority of deaths are occurring in institutional settings (i.e. nursing homes or hospitals where mild/moderate patients were unnecessarily admitted and infected others)?

We need to understand that "lockdowns" are one tool, but a better tool -- with a better cost-benefit equation for fighting coronavirus and preserving socio-economic well-being -- is to aggressively ensure nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and other institutional settings are well-managed and set up to combat coronavirus. For example, aggressively testing nursing home staff members, mandating exceptional hygiene procedures, and keeping mild/moderate COVID patients out of hospitals where they can infect doctors, nurses, and other vulnerable patients.

We need a needle and thread to win the battle against coronavirus, not a hammer.

I know Sweden's taking some heat for not enforcing mandatory social distancing right now, but it seems some form of their current system of highly encouraged optional social distancing is going to be what most countries will likely switch to sometime in the next few months, so I appreciate that they're basically making themselves the guinea pigs for that approach. I'm rooting for it it work over there, even if it makes our current lockdowns seem like overreactions in hindsight, because if it doesn't work I really don't know what we're going to do going forward.

Oh I totally agree with that, if it's barely working in Sweden it surely wouldn't work here, so it would probably need to be a fairly large success there to make sense as something we could adopt. I think there's definitely tweaking we could do as well, like stricter crowd limits, mandatory masks, hopefully better testing, etc. But I figure if even Sweden can't pull off what they're doing now, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the world.

I am pretty optimistic about the economy. I think people are very doom and gloom about it but I have a more positive outlook. This is where the free market is good. It can cause a lot of harm but it can also be a positive force.

Businesses will go under but new ones will rise to take their place. Restaurants that can handle delivery better will start popping up. People still need to eat. I expect you'll see other changes along those lines as well. People will lose the jobs they have but will get new ones. The key is keeping a seed of the economy going while it can undergo this transformation. That's where unemployment and government stimulus comes into play.

At one point in his life, Bill Robinson went seven-and-a-half years without seeing the sun. “Every time I was moved outside of a room, I was blindfolded so I didn’t get to see the sun,” recalled the longest-serving enlisted prisoner of war in American history.

We are not used to this, but my goodness, it could be so much worse. Things will get better. The sun will shine and your eyes will able to see it.

I know I'll be downvoted for dashing some people's hopes, but we must really reconsider antibody testing and certificates of immunity.
False positives
We don't have a 100% reliable test. Being exposed to another coronavirus like SARS1 or the flu may trigger a false positive antibody test. It would make you think you're immune. You let your guard down. Get COVID. Die.
Immunity may be temporary
I doubt people who get their lives back together will give it all up after six months to go back into quarantine. Also there were recent reports of patients in South Korea testing positive again after recovering. We don't have enough information on long term immunity at this point.
Patchwork employment doesn't work
A restaurant can't open with one sous chef, a hostess, and a valet. Letting only a few people get back to work would divide us and create animosity.
Most importantly, we can't give people an incentive to catch the virus
Fewer than 1% of the population has been infected and hospitals are already being overwhelmed. An incentive for the other 99% to contract the coronavirus would be disastrous. If people believe there's a good chance they will survive, can get back to work, feed their families, and get their lives back to normal, then millions will try and catch it.

A vaccine may be years away. To reopen the economy, we need a massive supply of COVID tests and simple medical masks for everyone. Cloth masks aren't enough. Of course there's a shortage right now. We could kill two birds with one stone if we could put people to work making medical masks. #Masks4All

For now, please reconsider antibody tests and the reopening of the economy. It's just too early. The death toll passed 120,000 and it's still rising. Let's not make it worse.

On a positive note, thank you so much for quarantining. It's working!

No one has really answered the main question with immunity certificates though - how will we prevent a massive amount of people intentionally trying to get infected so they could go back to their normal lives?

I know people who would certainly consider that to get back to work.

I get the sentiment but decisions about reopening the economy are top level decisions being made by world leaders in consultation with medical professionals and economists, the situation is so complex that there’s really no clear best path forward, and that’s why we’re seeing so many countries kind of doing their own thing in this

In theory very slightly possible but not meaningful. Very small bodies of water with tons of sick people might make it happen, but then again, you'd catch it from the people in the first place.

Bank of America started charging me a monthly maintenance fee last month that is usually waived due to me being enrolled in high school. I’m still enrolled! It’s sad that they are choosing students to pinch pennies from during this crisis. Check your bank accounts people because you might be getting played like me. (Don’t worry I’m going to call and get my money back, just wanted to notify others)

BoA is the worst of the worst. If possible, close the account completely and get your money out ASAP. Find a local credit union that's insured and open up there. Some even give $100 for opening a new account.

This is one thing I'm really curious about, while the percentages are low there are reports of younger age groups being stricken so quickly and dying. I know of one story about a young married couple where the wife had it with mild symptoms and gave it to husband who died very quickly after.

I would assume genetics plays a role on top of preexisting conditions but only time and research will tell.

I'm also wondering this. I haven't ever had the flu (only started getting the shot recently) and the only other thing I've ever had was a UTI once. I always wonder if I have a strong immune system or just lucky. I'm not exceptionally healthy or anything

Exactly the same as my situation. I haven’t gotten the flu shot since i was a kid (27 now) and i have never gotten the flu. I don’t even know what a fever feels like. knock on wood So either i am very lucky or i have a bionic immune system...really hoping it’s the latter lol. I’m like relatively healthy nothing too crazy, i take vitamins and eat vegetables but def still eat pizza and chips so who knows. Fingers crossed for both of us to remain healthy!

No guarantees but it's likely that you'll be able to get on an international commercial flight safely by year's end. You might need to jump through some hoops in order to show you can safely fly and the rules will be different by country, so watch for health regs in both your current location and your destination. Also, every commercial carrier is at risk of bankruptcy / liquidation to one extent or another right now, so I wouldn't book that discount airfare unless you were financially OK with never getting that money back should they fold.

Right dumb question incoming: what does viral load mean? I get that it's the amount of virus in your system but like, can you get a higher viral load from kissing someone with it than you can from shaking their hand or do they both give off the same viral load? And if you have the virus and touch something multiple times, does that give off a higher viral load than touching it once? Sorry if this is a dumb question just trying to wrap my head around it

Not a scientist so every number is made up...

Imagine a virus that doubles every hour 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,etc etc the body can kill a certain number per hour and a certain number don't reproduce, it takes a certain number to make you sick.

It makes a huge difference whether you get 100 virus or one during that exposure. Think of the difference in six feet away talking versus intubation, one creates much more virus spread. If you get one virus particle and it doesn't reproduce you've got no problem, if you get 100 and 47 reproduce, you've got bigger problems

The virus isn't going to magically die off. As long as it can, it will keep spreading between people. Short of every single living person on the planet locking themselves in a room by themselves and not having any contact with anyone else, for at least 30 days the virus isn't going away. What will help it appear to go away is us having an immunity to it. That'll either happen by most of the planet becoming infected and developing antibodies, or with the introduction of a vaccine.

Is the mail system still overwhelmed? I’ve been avoiding ordering anything unnecessary since I know they were drowning in orders at the start and I don’t want to be part of the problem.

But once things calm down I’d like to make a single order of some stuff to help keep my hands and brain busy. Idle hands are... definitely the devils play thing right now, lol

2 Questions r.e. Giving blood at this time and antibody treatment

1: I know they are asking people to give blood because of a shortage right now, but I’m still working and occasionally exposed to customers/members of the general public and I always wear a mask but they don’t.

I’m super concerned that I could give blood while being asymptomatic or before showing symptoms and accidentally kill someone.

So are they testing all the blood they take right now?

2: And a possibly dumb question:

if antibody serum treatment proves effective, can they take serum from person with antibodies and give it to healthy people as well as critically ill people and turn healthy people into farms for antibodies? Because I would sign up to be an antibody farm and give blood regularly.

Or does the immune system not learn how to make its own antibodies if it’s just given someone else’s? Because then I guess there would be no need for a vaccine...

But I’m not sure

Anyone is CA get unemployment yet? We applied March 22, so just over 3 weeks ago. Our certification for the first two weeks is still pending. I’m sure we’ll get it soonish but I’m just wondering how long it took for you if you’ve gotten it.

Luckily our stimulus direct deposit went in today so we can pay our bills for the rest of this month but I’m a little worried about our bills moving forward if it’s going to be a while longer 😬

Why is the UK only counting deaths from in the hospital? I would understand if they did not count them day-by-day, but instead added these deaths as they were registers.

However, they (to my knowledge) are not counting deaths in the community at all, which is ridiculous no when this virus predominantly effects the elderly?

For instance, today on the BBC they covered how one care home in England had over 13 patients die from COVID-19; and of course across the country many more deaths in the community will be occurring.

Does anyone understand the path for the US going forward? I'm really confused because I live in CA and have been reading how there are talks of easing stay-at-home orders. I've seen this for other places too. Wouldn't this literally just take us completely back and make the past 1+ month of everyone staying at home completely useless? So many of my friends have been talking/posting about how excited they are for this to happen and how they don't know how much longer they can wait for them to ease the orders. I don't understand how people don't see how counterproductive this would be and that we'll just end up in the same situation again, but worse.

It wouldn't if we opened up with the daily case count low enough and if we had enough testing and contact tracing. I also imagine the opening up would be in phases, so first phase I still imagine bars and restaurants and large public gatherings would be banned.

It's going to open up slowly and people still need to practice social distancing and good hygiene as much as possible. Seasonal effect might slow the spread enough for the summer for us to open up in some sort of way and still slow the spread. We will have much more extensive testing and ability to do. Contact tracing. These are all the positives I can see that show we can do it in a month or so.

All that being said I'm also scared we open too early and go right back to a lockdown in weeks to a month!

Is there a list of countries using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination (i.e. with ZPac/Zinc) for prophylactic or acute cases (prior to intubation not just end of life)? Dates and degree of usage also helpful (i.e. a trial versus an actual government policy). Trying to build out a dataset to determine correlations. So far, I've identified China, India, Belgium,Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia, Brazil, South Korea, and Poland as early adopters, some even using prescriptively. Spain, Italy, France are very late adopters and only limited. UK seems to not be using at all and US until recently was only using for end of life. I think several African countries are also using routinely by nature of chloroquine's treatment for Malaria.

Could there be a genetic factor in the deaths. Consider the different outcomes of Germany vs Italy. Also consider Italian American families where multiple family members die.
Any feedback from people personally affected would be great.

When it comes to anything health related, genetics always plays a role. But Italy happens to have an older population.

So I have two questions. When I was watching the news they said that Canada had developed a test that within 30 minutes will detect if a swab has the DNA of COVID-19, I thought that COVID-19 only had RNA in it, could anybody clear this up? Also, I have seen some "doctors" say that COVID-19 looks exactly like exosomes does this have any evidence behind it? Thanks!

Am I just bad at research, or is it really hard to find info about the death rates in US by age on google? Or any other specific info about covid on google? Every time I search google, the same basic info populates no matter what I search about covid. Searches produce the generic signs of illness and what to do, the heroes of pandemic, and the people refusing to social distance. At first I was just frustrated and annoyed

I am not a doctor. I have seen both anecdotal reports and more official preliminary reports that if you are going to get much worse than you already are, that that usually happens around day 10 from your symptoms starting. It’s usually on day 9, 10 or 11. So it’s possible, that if you are way past 2 weeks of being ill, and it is covid19, that you are not going to get worse than you already are.

It’s probably not going to get any harder for you to breathe than it is hard to breathe now. You are unlikely to need a ventilator in the future. If you actually have covid 19, and it’s been more than 2 weeks already, you are unlikely to die from it.

General question: (I already have an opinion on it but I want to see others thoughts) if a coworker of mine’s mother’s coworker tested positive, should said coworker be allowed at work considering the mother comes over to my coworkers house multiple times a week?

My supervisor says yes because she didn’t really have contact. But I think she did and should stay away. Thoughts?

No. Not unless her mother develops symptoms or tests positive.

If we took it that far, then you also should isolate because you've had contact with someone who has had contact with someone who has had contact with someone, and the chain never ends.

Are there any stories of immunocompromised cancer patients beating the disease or things like that?

There are still people not wearing masks in public places. So what is the point of wearing a cloth mask if people aren’t wearing one? Don’t you think it should be mandatory at this point? Especially since n95s aren’t available.

Bit out of the loop, could someone explain to me why Trump is supposedly beefing with the postal service?

I could definitely be missing something though so I just want to be sure I fully understand it.

Could the swine flu positive result mean sars-cov 2 positive? At the beginning of February, except for shortness of breath, I had Covid19 symptoms and returned from Paris to Istanbul. There were four cases in Paris at the time. There was no in Turkey. They told me that I had swine flu from my blood and nose test when I went to the hospital. I had read about some articles that claims covid19 can show swine flu test positive, but none were reliable. Is there anyone have an idea?

IMHE has updated their model for the US. This model increases the amount of deaths from 60k to 68k, mostly due to a slower decline than the previous model, which more closely matches what we are seeing in Spain and Italy (please note that the models for them have NOT been updated but I would anticipate they will be soon). According to the current model, today would be the peak number of deaths in US.

If it is correct that the peak is today (and I would guess more likely tomorrow), that means it took around ~22 days to go from sub-100 deaths a day to the peak. The model shows that it would take ~48 days to go from the peak to sub-100 deaths, at the beginning of June. So more than double the time to decline. This does seem more realistic than the previous model.

I am disappointed at the numbers as it means more deaths, but am very glad to see it consistently updated to keep pace with reality.

This is the model the federal govt has been using so I’m very curious as to what they do with it.

Guys I am so frigging pissed. My roommate managed to get scheduled for covid-19 testing tomorrow with very minimal symptoms. (No fever, but chills and aches). However, she has made no attempts to f***ing isolate herself since the first onset. We have two full bathrooms and lots of space so I don't understand why she couldn't be more forward thinking. All I can think about is how f***ing wrecked I'm gonna get next week because I drink too much and ate popeyes last week.

Im looking for some help to deal with this covid19 situation my family was placed in. My mother a hotel suite cleaner was recently mistreated by management and assigned to clean a room with a customer that was tested positive with covid19 in an isolation room. The company policy is that the supervisor of that day's shift is assigned to all isolation rooms. But the supervisor of that day's shift assigned my mother to that room without letting her know that it was an isolation room. I was wondering what should I do to help out my mother in this situation? This was some serious misconduct by the supervisor, not abiding to company policy, and putting my mother (who is almost a senior) at serious risk of contracting the virus.
Any suggestions on how to improve our situation(such as work safe laws, covid laws, compensation ideas etc) would be helpful.
I plan on going to management myself and asking them to give my mother at minimum a 2 week paid sick leave, but as I don't think there are any laws around scenarios like this, I would be lucky to get my mother any compensation at all.

A month ago, I went on a ski trip to Park City with some friends, one of whom exhibited symptoms of coronavirus. We gave him shit all weekend that he had it but he powered through. Anyways, he just got his antibody test back today and was informed that he did in fact have the covid. I was pretty vigilant with washing my hands and not touching my face all weekend long, but I was in close quarters with him for three days. When I returned home after the trip, I had night sweats the first two nights. Also, I had sporadic head pains over the next week and a half or so. He said that I most likely was exposed but I wanted to gauge the crowd's thoughts over here since where I currently live (Nashville, TN) doesn't have antibody testing yet.

What bothers me is how the goalposts keep moving. In CA, we were told, "two weeks to flatten the curve!" It worked. We flattened the curve. We will NOT exceed healthcare capacity. But they just tacked on another month, and I suspect they'll do it again May 15th. We went from "2 weeks to flatten the curve" to "until the numbers start declining" to "until we have a vaccine" to "Until the virus is eradicated".

I'm trying to rationalise this lockdown and the damage we're inflicting on our economy (UK here) in order to fight the pandemic and save lives etc. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's now plausible there could be economic depressions affecting many countries worldwide. Forgive me for being blunt here but I'm looking at the statistics for this virus and I can't justify the damage (economic) this lockdown is doing.

If or rather increasingly when we enter a depression, the misery and death toll will far, far out-way the suffering and death toll we have right now. We might not be there yet, but it's coming. I understand we are acting now and we think we're doing the right thing, or justifying it someway, but the long term ramifications of effectively shutting our economies down like this cannot be understated.

Interested to hear what people's thoughts are on this.

It’s shut down until we have the healthcare capacity to manage it along with all the other illnesses we get. The economy will be open soon enough.

There’s people behind the scenes a lot brighter than us doing the math on the most effective way forward. And they’ll be looking at black and white numbers rather than emotions.

Who are these bright people? Fauci has famously said he thinks the models are to be ignored because he needs to see actual data, and Cuomo showed about 5 different models that came up with 5 vastly different death tolls. I don’t think any of these people really know why we have sat at this weird plateau for like 6-8 days. And they certainly are not capable of predicting the regional behavior shifts that are coming as lockdown puts different regions in differing kinds of economic strain.

If I were to guess, the smart people see very well what worked and didn’t work in the past, but are just guessing what will work in the future. Their guesses are better than yours or mine, but not by much.

For those looking for good news, there were 400 fewer deaths in the United States yesterday than had been projected. If this drop off continues, we'll likely see the projected death toll revised down below 50k.

Usually when I swerve on the highway and narrowly avoid a deer, I don't get out of the car and scream at the deer for escaping my bumper. I don't demand a do-over to see if I can hit the deer on the second try. I don't say there never was a deer, as it bounds over the nearest hill in the woods. I take a deep breath, congratulate myself on successfully avoiding the collision, and proceed more carefully in case there are more deer.

Does anyone in your field expect an uptick in cases once restrictions are loosened? Curious if preparations are made for when we start letting people out freely or if it’s unacceptable to go over daily cases states currently have.

Just posting this to vent. I've spent a decade of professional life pretty much exclusively writing predictive models (I worked in finance).

The sheer extent of the "I know more than the experts" aspect of this whole thing - both on Reddit and across America - has been really disheartening to me. I'm used to know-it-alls and self-anointed geniuses - they're a dime a dozen in the stock trading world. But in this instance, this very Trumpian brand of false confidence is literally costing thousands of lives. In a country which has by far the most brilliant people in the planet, stupidity keeps winning the day.

I mean, I'm not an epidemiologist, so I listen to people who are qualified in the subject. I read their research methodology, their assumptions. I've spent hours over the last couple of months talking to friends and colleagues - many of whom are much smarter and more well informed than I am - about our predictions of the numbers, and as a result haven't been very surprised by anything that happened over the past month.

I understand that not everyone has the background or the resources to fully understand these models, but it's frustrating to see people bash experts for silly reasons like deaths not being exactly what they had predicted. When people go "That settles it. I'll go with my gut feeling/slapdash analysis instead of listening to the experts" instead of "Maybe I'm not fully getting what these models imply", the quant in me dies a little inside.

I can see your frustration but it's difficult to blame confused, scared people whose lives have basically ground to a screeching halt for drawing their own conclusions when this is what we're dealing with. Those we are supposed to be able to look to for guidance and leadership at worst have bungled the hell out of this and at best sit and say "sorry we don't have any answers yet, we're still learning!"

Please help me. I cannot get my bf to wear a mask when grocery shopping, the only time we leave the house 1-2 times per month. He hired movers for our move at the end of April and he refuses to wear a mask. I confronted him and said he could be the reason why I am killed and he says I am selfish and only care about myself (I am immunocompromised). He says I am “extra” and now is angry with me and says he is absolutely not wearing a mask when the movers are here and that he’s just “not going to talk to me for 14 days after we move”. I said that is so stupid because to avoid that, YOU COULD JUST WEAR A MASK. I can’t get him to take anything I say seriously, and I don’t know what to do!! I am wearing my mask when they are here, the entire time. Should I also wear it 24/7 around the house after the moving day? I’m terrified his vanity and selfishness is going to get me killed! (I sewed us cloth masks)

Edit to add: Not sure why I am being downvoted. I am quarantined in my house, only leave to grocery shop 1-2 times, sewed my own mask, and am immunocompromised. I asked for advice. There’s nothing I have done to risk anyone’s health, and no reason to downvote me.

Your boyfriend sounds like trash. You are literally one of the most vulnerable members of society right now and instead of taking one tiny step to help protect you, he's mocking you, belittling you, and being angry with you. This is abusive behavior. Seriously, what harm is it to him to wear a mask for your own safety? Says a hell of a lot about him and what he thinks of you.

Sounds like you need a new boyfriend. You’re immunocompromised and he basically just told you he doesn’t care. Seriously, ditch him. Find someone who will respect you and your condition. People are showing their true colors in this.

I know this isn't r/relationshipadvice, but by being with him while immunocompromised you will share whatever he gets.

Seeing as you plainly stated that he could literally kill you by not wearing it and he scoffed it off by getting angry at you, I don't think there's things Reddit can say to help you convince him.

The good news is, the chances of you getting it while only leaving the house 1-2 times a month is pretty low, but it's still possible.

Best thing you can do is be as safe as possible and keep yourself clean. If you have your own mask, gloves, PPE, cleaning supplies, wear and use them, and avoid others as much as possible.

In the end, you have to interact with other humans at some point, so you can only be as safe as possible. If your boyfriend doesn't want to contribute and you continue to be with him, you share all the risks that entails.

Anybody else find their state's subreddits being overrun by denialists and trolls? I made a post about nobody wearing masks when I went grocery shopping for my parents and it got downvoted to hell. I tried talking to the mods and the only reasonable one said he tries to nuke the trolls but the other mods keep undoing the bans or post removals. People are going to get killed because of these death cult members spreading bullshit.

YIKES! Japan's COVID-19 death rate is "skyrocketing" out of control. Those silly Japanese people are really being punished for not implementing aggressive lockdowns (their constitution makes them illegal) -- yes, sir!

All the Westerners who said Japan was being irresponsible for not behaving like the Chinese and welding their people into apartment buildings and dragging them off to dirty "fever hospitals" were totally wrong.

Things in Japan are very bad.

Wait for it! Wait for it!

Today, Japan has a whopping seven new deaths in a country of 127 million people with the world's oldest population.

I just wanted to share this with everybody on Reddit... I’ve been having a hard time finding nitrile gloves during Covid-19, but then I realized something 99% of people seem to not think of...

When at Walmart. Go to the AUTOMOTIVE and the PAINTING section. I’ve been to 3 local Walmart’s and each one had 4+ heavy duty “grease monkey” brand nitrile gloves in size large, for $6.88 each. They’re near the oil changing supplies AND the paint remover supplies at the 3 locations I visited.

Hopefully this helps out some of you guys who have been looking for gloves but unable to find them. Think outside the box, and stay safe out there!

I am just so beyond frustrated. All this talk of "oh, CA is flattening curve, some places may return to normal May 1.....etc" is SO annoying. Like, There are 3-4 things that NEED to happen to START opening things back up, but the # 1 thing is testing. Across the board. Testing and tracing so we can stop small pockets before they get out of hand. We still don't have easy and reliable access to tests (In the US) and not only is that causing our numbers to skew morbid (since they implies a high rate of cases that never get captured) but if we can't figure out where new outbreaks are happening rapidly, we can't return.



I don't think we need to wait for a cure, we just need to wait until the systems are in place to allow people to move about with mitigated risk. And until I can get a test, as an Asymptomatic person, with not questions asked, it should not happen.



yes, there are other factors. Tracing, Mask wearing, allowing groups / swing days for in office work that cannot be done at home, but before ANY of that, we. need. testing. And we still don't have it.

What's even more frustrating is there have no been no realistic timelines set to accomplish any of those tasks. Government talks about re-opening in May or maybe June/July, but nothing has been said about when there will be sufficient testing capacity or PPE production or antibody tests. Just empty promises to win the daily news cycle.

Seems the conclusion is either:

Social distancing policies have also reduced the spread of the flu and flu deaths.

Those deaths are incorrectly being misclassified as COVID.

A little bit of both.

The model at https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america increased its estimated deaths to 68K from 60K - probably because the decline in deaths in Spain/Italy doesn't seem to be happening as fast as it did in China/Korea. Not good news for the US, especially because it assumes "full social distancing through May 2020", which is surely not going to happen.

I think once the numbers really go down, restrictions will be relaxed slowly. People will start going back to work. Public places will open up with many precautions and social distancing measures in place. With each step we wait and see what happens.

Closest to normal will be after widespread vaccine deployment. The timeline for this vaccine looks like 12-18 months plus production and distribution time. I don’t know how I feel about rushing things more than that. Vaccine development is a long process largely due to comprehensive trials that determine all possible side effects and downsides. I’m sure most people would jump on any vaccine but I’d like it to be done right the first time.

"With no social restrictions" is wrong because they are following social distancing. Yes technically people can still go to the bar, but overall traffic is way down and if you are there, it is only table service 6' from other people.

Here is a good post in another sub from a Swede.

"I think the Swedish course of action has been a bit misreported. The general feeling here is that we're under lockdown. A couple of key differences from comparable countries:

Schoools and kindergardens remain open.

Bars and cafes remain open.

Most of the regulations are "recommendations" rather than laws.

We're currently seeing a huge spike in unemployment - because while shops and bars are open very few people are visiting them, because we're recommended not to. The last point is simply one of political culture in Sweden, and the idea that social pressure is more efficient than judicial pressure in this case. So while it's true that there are people going to bars in Stockholm (the only region that's actually hit hard), they are much fewer than normal.

When it comes to schools, keeping them open is based on the idea that there's little evidence that children drive the pandemic, and that closing schools has other effects - for example complicating life for essential workers who need their kids at school to be able to go to work, and that there's further risk that if they can't be at school, they'll be taken care of by older relatives who are at risk.

My impression is that the countries who have ordered shutdowns of schools and kindergardens have not done so on the advice of scientists, but as a political move to calm the public and be seen to do everything possible. Most countries are now discussing opening schools. Norway, Denmark and Finland who all closed schools are now opening them to some degree.

No country in Europe is seriously attempting to get rid of the spread completely by these kinds of orders - everyone is trying to lower the transmission rate, i.e. flattening the curve. My impression is that the Swedish model does that about as well as other countries. It doesn't seem like our almost-empty (but not completely empty) buses, cafes and restaurants are driving this pandemic. Perhaps because transmission isn't really likely to occur in places like that unless they're crowded, which they aren't.

Most severe cases and fatalities in Sweden belong to one of two groups: poor immigrants who are living in small apartments with many generations under one roof, or people living in retirement homes where there's been a lot of spread despite the fact that it's one of the few places where there's been a law to ban outside visitors. None of these two main cases are primarily related to bars or cafes being open, but to other issues. Bad living conditions for the first group, and for the second group we simply don't know right now - it can't be explained with a difference in approach though. My guess however is that the revised guidelines for sick pay etc that were introduced to keep ill people at home without economic consequences missed some of the zero hour contract workers in elderly care. I don't know how that worked in other countries.

When it comes to Swedish numbers keep in mind the following: in the beginning of the epidemic, everyone with symtoms was tested and there was extensive contact tracing. When there were indications of societal spread the strategy shifted to pushing resources to risk groups (health care workers, patients, the elderly etc). So right now testing is reserved for risk groups which means we're likely to have a high number of positive cases in relation to tests. It also means we're likely to severely underreport incidence - the latest estimates are that somewhere between 2,5% and 10% of the population in Stockholm carry the virus which would put fatality rates at the lower levels we know of (about 0,3%-0,5%).

Another reason why Sweden seems to have a higher death rate than neighboring countries, like Norway, is that Sweden is reporting every death of someone who's corona positive (like Italy). Norway is reporting what individual doctors determine are deaths because of corona.

TL;DR: Don't compare Swedish numbers to Danish or Norwegian numbers without taking different testing and reporting regimes into account. Sweden is under lockdown but not as harsh a one as comparable countries - however, that difference does not seem to have a meaningful impact on the spread of the disease. Essentially transmission in public places seems to be very low, despite the fact that public spaces aren't 100% shut down. The Swedish strategy isn't that different from other countries, there's simply a disagreement on how efficient some shutdown measures are. Herd immunity isn't a "strategy", it's simply the realistic end of any epidemic, in Sweden and in other countries who don't see a realistic way of ending the disease with shutdown measures."

At this point it probably would be better to switch to antibody testing (which would tell you whether you had covid in the past), they are being approved in many countries right now, China has recently began to offer it on a wider scale (a few thousand people per day, about 30USD per test), so we know it is scalable, accuracy is reported at over 90% so we just need production to pick up at this point.

Of what, medical equipment? They stopped a bunch to the Caribbean, then the ambassadors got that released. I am sure Israel will have no problem getting Kushner to release shipments for them.

Does anyone have the data that says just how many people who catch COVID develop permanent lung damage, and if its tied to other health issues? Of all things, I'm healthy with no disorders or complications, but as a runner losing up to 20% of my capacity is a terrifying thought.

An ex professional football player for the team I support tested positive for the virus. He's 50 now and he recovered well but he said recently that he is currently not able to exercise for more than 10 minutes without feeling exhausted. He might be an exception to the rule but it shows that even the healthy ones can have complications with their lungs after recovery.

Oh I saw in the news that in South Korea 91 people retested positive. Maybe it’s still in their bodies from the initial infection

Virologist from Columbia University. Click on some of her tweets and their is some decent discussion. I like how you said "retested" positive instead of saying people are being reinfected!

We still don't know for sure if those who get infected, can get reinfected again after initial recovery.

We also don't know if getting infected again, assuming it's possible, would result in the same complications from the first infection. The second infection and beyond might be very harmless.

Correct, but science/medical field are heavily leaning towards immunity after recovery. We may not know but we have a really great hypothesis. Discussion from Fauci and others is length of immunity is a big unknown. The Reuters article about reinfection is complete fear porn.

I think it's more likely that the test they got to declare them as "recovered" was wrong, for people who are positive for a long time, the viral concentration in the airway becomes so low that the chances that a PCR test can pick it up is only 10%. So even if you tested negative twice it is over 80% likelihood they are false negatives.

If you were admmitted to ICU and then recovered and discharged would you still test negative ? I guess what I'm asking is how soon after revovery would a test give a negative result?

Testing is tricky. If you tested positive at discharge, you are probably positive, but if you tested negative you should still act like you are positive, because after a certain number of days the tests become really, really bad at picking up a positive person's viral RNA, because the concentration is super low when you have recovered enough to be asymptomatic. On the plus side, those people are probably a great deal less infectious than people with a high viral count, but we don't know yet.

Is it possible for the first symptom to be difficulty breathing? I haven't had any fever or dry cough but I suddenly don't get full breaths of air (could also be stress-related I think). At what point should I get worried?

If you think it might be stress-related, it's probably stress-related. Try to do something to calm down (read a book, go for a walk) and see if it persists or not.

Shouldn't we know more about this virus by now? Or is this normal for a new virus? I feel like a few months into an outbreak, we should know more than we do. It seems there are a lot of unknowns still.

Take the Spanish flu or the bubonic plague for example, nobody knew anything when those diseases came around even with our modern tech there will obviously be many unknowns with a new virus.

I think several things need to happen, the most urgent one being we need the healthcare system to be robust enough to handle the extra cases that the opening will bring. We also need to accurately identify those who had the disease and is now immune (China is giving antibody tests for $30 USD a pop, but not yet available to everyone) and those who are not asymptomatic carriers (faster and more accurate testing than what we have now). Those two groups of people could in theory mix safely. However, extensive contact tracing should probably be to be in place so that as soon as one of them develop symptoms we will need to isolate not only them but also people they have been in close contact with a few days prior. China and South Korea were able to do this, several countries are talking about it, I am not sure how the West would be able to do this without massive invasions to privacy but are lot of people are thinking about these problems right now and I'm optimistic that they will come up with solutions.

Or we say "f*** it" and just open up again and expect a number of people to die as a result. I think this method is the worst for both lives and the economy (people will spend less money when they are afraid), and I fear we are heading this way just because it's the easiest thing to do for leaders.

My apologies if this is a silly question or not the right place to be asking, but does anyone know if it’s safe to eat sushi right now?? I’m terrified by the thought of my local sushi joint having to close down, and I’m trying to support local businesses as much as possible right now, but uncooked fish...? It seems like a bad idea but I’m hoping someone will convince me otherwise.

Thanks! I guess I’m just concerned by he fact that sushi isn’t heated, and heating food typically kills germs/ bacteria/ infectious materials etc. I’m not too worried about hot foods like burgers and wings, or physically going to a restaurant. It’s the raw fish I’m concerned about.

If somebody got the virus on a raw Patty, cooking would probably help. But nobody is cooking the cheese, bun, lettuce etc. The container also is not put in the oven as well, so anything you get has some risk.

Clinically, they appear to be the same. Some researchers think one strain might be more infectious, but that is only because they found that it was more common. To the best of my knowledge, the strain has no impact on survival and outcome.

How is "fatality rate" calculated? WHO is saying the fatality rate is 7% worldwide, but when you compare number of deaths to number of recoveries, it's more like 25% (as of right now 117,659 dead vs 434,915 recovered) source: https://ncov2019.live/data , though the numbers are similar on other sites.

So clearly they're including something other than the raw numbers of recoveries and deaths from the virus. How is that 7% value calculated?

The big problem is that in some countries people with symptoms are being refused tests. The government know how many people have been told they likely have it.

My friend has been told by gp that he almost certainly has it but they can’t afford to waste a test on him as he’s young. They’re only testing people in hospital who are automatically the people already on their last legs.

Hey!

So like many of you may be dealing with, my building (owned by a huge management company in chicago/IL) have only taken some action for those struggling to pay this month. Basically they said that we can pay half by the 15th and the rest by the 30th and they dropped off some paperwork for me to sign.

Unfortunately, I was only able to work from home for two weeks before being furloughed. I did get my last paycheck but I don't make much more than what my rent is so I don't have much right now for me to be able to pay the full amount and then be able to afford necessities. I applied for unemployment over 2 weeks ago and nothing has come to me even though many friends got their money and those stimulus checks. I understand this is an intense time for everyone so I'm hoping the money comes soon.

There's a lot of hope for things to be better by the end of this month but I'm not too sure. I'm thinking it'll be a slow roll once things to do get better (i.e. groups of 10 allowed again, then slightly bigger gatherings, then smaller capacity restaurants/bars and so forth). Since the company I work for makes money off of people dining at restaurants, I don't know how soon after restaurants reopen that they will give us our work back.

Is there any advice that anyone can give on what I can do? Should I just pay it this month? Is there anything in place to protect tenants if they do not pay due to Covid? As mentioned, my building is owned by a big management company so it's not like a single landlord who may need the money for their own expenses. But I'm afraid of eviction. I don't have any family in Illinois and don't have savings so I'm freaking out. Also I hope this doesn't come out as "woe is me". I understand so, so many people are in the same or similar situations and I hope anything shared within this thread can be of help for anyone struggling.

I also tried to post this within a Chicago-specific subreddit but it got removed.

Courts are likely closed so they wouldn't be able to process your eviction anyways. Prioritize your needs first (food, medication etc) then go to your landlord with what you have left and work out a payment plan for the rest.

For folks in the US -- seeking thoughts on the logic behind asking/ordering via Defense Production Act (DPA) an automobile manufacture to retool and make small rectangular boxes that deliver air as opposed to say, an air conditioner manufacturer, which is already manufacturing product in a shape similar to what is needed for a ventilator and also happens to have "delivering air" as a fundamental component/requirement? Seems to me that Carrier (an air conditioner manufacturer in the US) could easily retool and crank vents out much quicker than GM / Ford etc.

The answer may seem political and therefore, would be removed. But if you will recall, there was a time when the Trump administration rolled back the Obama era automobile emissions standards, but California kept them and GM said, you know what... we are going to go ahead and keep abiding by the Obama standards.

What would make sense is for the DPA to be used on already existing ventilator manufacturers so that they manufactured at capacity and for low costs...

Now GM is being forced to create an untested ventilator and they will not roll out until June...

The auto industry was "bailed out" several years ago, but I am unaware if the US Govt took an equity position in GM, and IIRC, the auto manufacturers paid back the bailout funds. I am more curious about the scale of change that a car maker would need to make to the factory floor to mass produce ventilators as opposed to a manufacturer like Carrier https://www.corporate.carrier.com/ especially where time is of the essence to some degree and demand globally is likely to increase for the foreseeable future.

How can we know if the curve is flattening or if we have just reached testing capacity? Thanks

We did reach testing capacity which makes it near-impossible to know whether the curve flattened. We can infer and make educated guesses based on the % of positive cases growing or decreasing, but if testing capacity remains the same we'll only be able to back-date the time it had flattening once the numbers of positive cases had steadily decreased for some days.

Check the numbers for new hospitalizations. That is why new York is confident it has flattened the curve. New cases are rather meaningless especially after a weekend and Easter Sunday.

There's no testing capacity, only thresholds.

Selective testing is a very real thing. Local media here is a bunch of f***ing rat bastards. Hospital has 100 people show up wanting a test. Hospital refuses 95 of them because no health insurance, can't afford co-pay, no fever higher than 102, etc. The other 5 folks get tested and all are negative. This is frontloaded by the media as zero tests and curve being flattened. Meanwhile of the other 95 they didn't test, 20 of them have it.

Looking at the numbers, your chances of death due to coronavirus are still really low. Now is the time to change your habits to healthier ones, not only will it benefit you for this pandemic, but for the rest of your life. You won't die young, start taking care of your health now and you'll live a long happy life.

Residential plumber here that also does some city sewer work. There have not been any issues with the increased usage in my area. There was a story about an increase in sales of plungers and chemical drain cleaners but I think most people are dealing with plumbing related issues themselves either because they don’t want someone in their house or because they don’t have the money to pay a plumber.

I don't come to this sub daily so I have a question that may have been answered. How have the estimates for total number of deaths for the US gone down so drastically? Initial estimates a month ago were upwards of a million dying. Then the trump organization said 100-250k if we do things almost perfect a week plus ago. Now the latest estimates were 60k if we continue social distancing through May. Still a terrible number of people but I dont think we did things almost perfect although Gov Kelly has done a good job here in Kansas IMO.

From what I have gathered Neil Ferguson put out the first “real” models. They were grossly over projected mainly because they didn’t have a whole lot of data to go off of. Afterwards Ferguson was like yea we made the wrong estimation and this is what we now believe will happen. FEMA started collecting data and models and were making projections on if nothing ever happened if we just continued life. Those were on the high side of things because there were no factors of restrictions. Chris Murray was then being popular and his models were starting to be used within the United States what you hear as IMHE. IMHE collected more data and provide updates in relation to that data, and that’s why we see the confidence levels shrink and projections adjust downward.

The unknowns are projections after we reduce social distancing. IMHE only projects for current measures in place. The thing we need to be aware of is we are not getting rid of the virus just slowing it down to keep medical centers from being overwhelmed.

We are all focused on coronavirus impacts, but there is one aspect I haven't seen any information on. Maybe someone has a source?

What is the overall death rate from all causes? How much is social distancing impacting that? I'm thinking that there's probably an increase in medical related cases from people who are getting delayed treatments, at the same time, I'd guess that car crash fatalities and industrial accidents, among others, are down significantly.

All of that is somewhat on the back burner, but it has important implications in the grand scheme of things.

Where can I find this type of info, or is it not collected in realtime?

Any advice? My friend in florida and her entire family woke up on saturday with flu symptoms. 102.3 fever, nausea, chills, congestion, sore throat, muscle soreness "so bad she could barely lift her legs up" they called 3 different doctors, all told to isolate. they are getting worse and she finally got a referral for a test today.

test screener said they don't qualify because they aren't "a first responder, 65+ or have breathing issues"

she said she has never felt so demeaned on a phone call before. any advice?

Sadly this is what's happening throughout the US. Health systems are overwhelmed, there's not enough tests, and people on the phones are constantly having to deny treatment to those who desperately need it.

Tests are for all intents and purposes meaningless. Untold thousands are in the same boat, no tests available or they don't fit the criteria, and they get the same treatment as those that do get tested. This is the reality of having coronavirus, and staying isolated at home is the best case scenario.

Each locale has different hospitalization criteria. By the time you fit the criteria for an ICU bed, your survival chances are very low.

It’s clear that it’s drastically understated. I personally know multiple people who have been refused tests after being diagnosed through all other means and repeatedly going to the hospitals demanding admittance. The doctor reports saying for every 1 tested positive x by 10 probably isn’t that terribly far off.

The test won’t change anything. Just isolate until they have to go to the hospital. If that happens the. They’ll get tested. Even if they test positive they are just going to be told to go home and isolate.

PSA for my fellow math geeks trying to determine morality rate. If someone dies today, you don't use the total infections *today* as your base when determining percentage. You have to look at total number of infections there were at the time that the time that the person was infected.

For example, if you have 650 deaths in your region but have 220,000 cases you would not divide 650/220000. You would have to look at the number of cases 2-3 weeks ago, since that's about how long it takes for someone who is infected to develop symptoms strong enough to cause death. (If someone has a better source/estimate on this timeframe, please let me know). Let's say you look that up and find it was about 100k cases at that time. You then divide 650/110000 = 0.006 or 0.6% mortality.

Sure, but the time it takes to die varies a lot. If two people died today, one may have gotten it 13 days ago and the other may have gotten it 20

And you also need to know everyone who was infected, which is impossible since testing is basically reserved for the severely ill at this point. This makes the mortality rate appear way higher than it really is

Much appreciated and that helps. I agree that the plan has been to reduce the strain on the healthcare system until there is a vaccine or other good approach to mitigate impact. I just haven't followed closely enough to know the differences in what changed between the most common projections I was seeing.

They do. They are called N95 and N99 respirators. They are expensive and more difficult to make. They are in high demand and especially important for healthcare providers who are forced to be in locations with a high amount of the virus. Everyone else doesn't need that, because we aren't in a dangerous location. We can stay home and be safe.

Not over. I think people on both sides have forgotten the whole idea of these restrictions. Flatten the curve does not mean you will never get sick. The whole idea was so that hospitals do not get over ran. The more PPE, equipment, and tests the better prepared we are so that health facilities are not over ran. We just spread the virus out over long term.

Besides the fact SARS, MERS and COVID are coronaviruses, H1N1 and Spanish flu are influenza viruses (and the Spanish flu is was probably an H1N1 strain). Ebola virus is in its own thing.

Covid is similar to SARS, less lethal, but more contagious

What are the most relevant differences between the coronavirus and other past epidemics like Sars, Mers, H1N1, Ebola and Spanish Flu?

SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all originated from coronavirus jumping from zoology to humanology. SARS and MERS are difficult to transmit human-to-human. This is not the case with COVID-19 and that is why this has a significantly higher risk to our population.

EBOLA is a whole other beast combining high fatality with easy transmission. Prompt action in 2016 stamped it out in the United States.

H1N1 and Spanish Flu, were the same virus. It was actually noted in 2009 that those who had Spanish flu originally were judged to be immune to H1N1/Swine Flu.

I've been having slight pressure on my chest the past few days, and my breathing seems a little off. It's not a struggle for me to breathe, but every minute or two I feel the need to take a deep breath.

I don't have a cough, I dont feel sick, and I dont believe I have a fever. Just pressure in my chest and slight breathing issues. Also, for what it's worth, I just got over Strep about a week/week and a half ago.

I'm not sure when I should start considering calling a doctor to get a test, or maybe if it's something else.

I would say just keep monitoring your symptoms and take it easy. Drink lots of water and take paracetamol/aspirin. If you get worse, then call the doctor and see what they advise.

Symptoms vary so wildly from one person to the next the vast majority of us will never know we had it without an antibody test.

Math Problem: Looking for the new 70% alcohol homemade hand sanitizer recipe???

So I found some 91% alcohol, I have some aloe gel, and essential oils.

Most recipes online notes using 2/3 parts 91% alcohol, 1/3 aloe gel = somewhere between 60.66% -65% alcohol content.

Now the CDC is recommending 70% alcohol based hand sanitizers, what should the ratio / recipe now be?

Math too hard for my brain, help!

I could be wrong, but I would assume it’s

.70 / .91 = .78

Therefore I would assume 4 parts alcohol to 1 part what ever you want to use with it.

So 4 parts alcohol and 1 part aloe gel. I wouldn’t take this as fact I threw some numbers together to try it out.

Proofs

2/3 = .6666667 multipled by 91% yields you 60.66% But heavy hands could make it strong or weaker.

4/5 = .80 multipled by 91% yields you 72.5%

Is there a subreddit or somewhere that I can post articles or video specifically with the intention of debunking them? My parents keep sending all this pro-trump crap that's all full of conspiracy theories and nonsense but it's hard to refute everything. Theres just so much of it.

And at this point not sure if me refuting everything even gets through to them tho

Like this video for example

I guess people are still hoarding toilet paper/paper towels and now meat. I am completely out of toilet paper and went to two different Wal-Mart's. Both were completely out of stock of TP and paper towels and had absolutely no meat. Not even the low quality stuff. I grabbed a small package of baby wipes to use until Wednesday when I get my stimulus check but I felt bad about buying that too. :/

It might be worth a trip to your local chain pharmacy (Walgreens, CVS, Shoppers') to check for meat, TP, and paper towels. Mine nearby had all 3 while the supermarket has been sold out now for a month.

I do check both, the layout on coronawiki is way nicer! The World Stats overview is quick and easy.

I believe he's doing county data and that's why it's wonky. 1 county in Florida is reporting over 100k cases which is throwing off the overall data.

Does anyone know if today's numbers for US are real? Like, this morning there were around 560,000 cases, and right now the case toll is at 682,000 or so. Seems to me like an unrealustically huge increase in just one day! Please tell me what's going on

Someone else here said the Florida data had a typo in it, if that is correct it should be fixed soon. It should be 582000, not 682000.

Could reduction of people inside well-disinfected buildings/events potentially reduce severe cases due to a less comparative viral load vs a full capacity one? In other words, even if numbers rise if a country reduces lockdown measures, would those cases potentially be less severe than what we’re seeing right now? So we’ll be seeing a lot of mild sickness?

i guess look at the things that will run out and the worst case scenerio would have their substitutes run out.

dumb example: if my sandwich size bags run out i'm gonna be using all the quart size bags. if my napkins run out, i'll use my paper towels.

more relevant example: if the ventilator drugs run out, there's probably back up drugs (nitrous oxide?) that would run out too as people switch over to it. if hydrowhatever runs out, there's probably a back up lupus medicine that will run out too. if PPE runs out, trash bags will start to run out. etc etc

the same would be true in stores, businesses, etc. your main staff will get sick and quarantine and the newer ones will be running the show some days, the hotline will be unmanned at times, the ambulances will be slower at times, etc in the worst case scenario

I've been following this thing since January and only now am I confused...why is NYC really the only major hotbed in the U.S.? Yeah other cities have it too but nothing comes close to NYC. Nobody is doing legit lock-downs. I assume NYC closed schools and restaurants too. I've been waiting for other places to explode but it just never comes despite being 10-14 days behind Italy or NYC.

Just found out today that my employer will reimburse up to $50 for a mask. I won't be able to get an n95, so what's my next best option?

Overall anything is better than nothing for protecting others from you. Most of the disposal mask options are not available as everyone has been buying them out en mass. Last I've seen a double layer of cotton cloth with mid to high thread count seems to be best for reusable masks.

Los Angeles County resident here. I go for runs in the morning. Do I have to wear a mask because I’ll get a ticket? Or is it only for when you’re in grocery stores, etc.? I saw 3 people today on my run around my neighborhood. All social distancing (we crossed the street so we Wouldn’t get close)

Just out of curiosity, my mom is especially allergic to pollen, barely being outside and she starts sneezing and feeling ill. Could this mean the virus would affect worse or does one thing have nothing to do with the other? Thanks.

Dogs in theory can be passive vectors as (again in theory) the dog could carry the virus on their coats. I haven't seen this proven in any studies but it still could be a thing. Basically just wash your hands after handling another person's pets.

Hey a coworker of mine is allergic to the masks my store issues. She went to her doctor but her doctor said cloth masks don't protect from covid-19, and won't write her a note saying that she's allergic to the masks.

She's considering quitting because her face is full of pimples and rash right now.

mask most likely help both ways, but more to protect others around. So if everyone is wearing them, she will be fine with a cloth one. And a cloth one even not perfect, is much better than nothing. Is about protecting each others here!

I know I've been telling my coworkers that the masks don't protect from covid-19, but simply reduce the droplets we exhale out onto others on the assumption that everyone is infected but asymptomatic.

The problem is that she's living paycheck to paycheck and her husband is currently an immunocompromised cancer survivor. I've suggested that she negotiate with management over it and speak to our union rep since I don't have the authority to negotiate for her.

I've had this conversation with many people but doctors are not automatically brilliant legal minds. The amount of effort required to even become a doctor doesn't leave much for anything else.

A long time ago, a relative had to keep going back to their doctor to revise their note because the doctor wrote the note in such casual (ambiguous) language that the insurance wouldn't take it. He literally did not understand that he had to say things in a specific way for it to work for insurance purposes, and he was a good doctor.

In Canada, court rooms will be opening back up on June 3rd. So it makes sense for travel restrictions to be lifted around the same time too.

Depends on the government response, we'll have to see.

I doubt it. My guess is that we won't see a worldwide lift until a vaccine or a progressive herd immunity of minimum 80%(best at 95%) is achieve world wide. Second guess is an international ID system to be given to confirmed immune traveler only.

Both perspective is we won't see any personal travelling for a long time. Only buisness and freight travel.

I do hope it won't last till next year, I have my sister wedding in mexico in march 2021.

Wear a mask. Give him a mask if he doesn’t have one (he might. My state just issued an order that anyone working with the public must be provided with a face covering by their employer).

When he leaves, disinfect everything he touched or might have touched. Clean your floors, too.

I’m of the opinion that gloves are totally helpful in most circumstances but... when it comes down to it, rigorous hand-washing is better than anything else.

When will we know that the worst is over and society can go back to something akin to normal?

I heard it will be after so many people have caught it and recovered that the remaining number cannot overwhelm the healthcare system. That a herd immunity forms, partially protecting the few who haven't caught it.

But how will we know? It's said that there can be very mild symptoms, so mild that it can be mistaken as something else entirely. So the only way to accurately know the numbers is widespread testing for antibodies, right? Having those numbers would also give accurate information to researchers on symptoms, spread and if there's any reinfection or not, things that researchers say they don't have data on now.

So why aren't they running tests to see who has already caught it and recovered?

“As governors across the country fell into line in recent weeks, South Dakota’s top elected leader stood firm: There would be no statewide order to stay home,” the Washington Post reports.

“Such edicts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) said disparagingly, reflected a ‘herd mentality.’ It was up to individuals — not government — to decide whether ‘to exercise their right to work, to worship and to play. Or to even stay at home.'”

“But now South Dakota is home to one of the largest single coronavirus clusters anywhere in the United States, with more than 300 workers at a giant ­pork-processing plant falling ill. With the case numbers continuing to spike, the company was forced to announce the indefinite closure of the facility Sunday, threatening the U.S. food supply.”

Pretty nerving to see this happening everywhere in the US with meat processing facilities. My family is involved with processors in the Midwest. People are so close together on the lines and you can’t a line down to keep distances like you may be able to do in other manufacturing facilities.

I'm so confused, I see so many different numbers thrown around, what is the actual likely death rate of COVID-19? Including all estimated infections right now, obviously we won't be able to test for all of them. I've seen some people say 5 or 6%, there's no way it's that high right?

Honestly it could be anywhere from 2% to .1%. We won't know until there's widespread serological tests to see what percentage of the population has gotten it. Fwiw a serological test in Germany pegged the mortality rate at around .3-.4%.

Yea so confused about that. I don’t think WHO even knows what they are saying anymore.

‘We can only say what we know, and we can only act on what we know’, WHO chief

Then they go on about how the US should be so careful about reopening from a statement that said the death rate of this virus would be less than 1%.

Next I feel like they are going to say well we did say 10x higher but we didn’t not say 100x higher.

People I know are posting articles to Facebook about how test kits bound for the UK were found to be contaminated with covid already, and this is obviously part of the set up to make the numbers look artificially higher than they are. What are the logical explanations for this? I’m so tired of people posting all these damn conspiracy theories every damn day.

People do anything for the clicks (especially the aunties on Facebook), just ignore them. And you answered the question, they're conspiracy theories not facts!

All the cells in a body don't immediately die the moment a person's heart stops.

Edit:

Skin, tendons, heart valves and corneas will still be alive after a day. White blood cells, which are more independent, can keep going for almost three days.

Hello people of reddit!

My SO is an ENT (otorhinolaryngology) doctor and we are discussing what changes/adjustments are needed in the clinical setting once regular practice resumes.

We agreed the need to setup the clinic as negative pressure for procedures involving a suction machine (threat of aerosolization).

We agree that a new set of PPE per patient would be the proper approach, but this is not feasible in a third world country like ours. This will drive the cost of a checkup so high that it would simply be unaffordable. What would be a feasible alternative? Would an acrylic box that would contain the patient and allow a certain degree of movement (protruding gloves etc) for both patient and doctor to do a procedure be a viable alternative(safety and decontamination wise)?

So what im asking is, is there a literature tackling this issue, what is it called? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I have a question: If I have beaten coronavirus am I allowed to go out and buy groceries again? My question can be answered quite easily but if someone here has already beaten it; is it easy to go "back" to work or have your usual routine without being socially locked down upon? (meaning that people are saying that you can't be near them because they are reasonably afraid) I know at this time there isn't really social interaction but basically I would like to know how life is after you have beaten corona?

If you're totally recovered and no longer contagious according to the legal guidelines, yes. Actually, out of the whole population, the people who had it and recovered will be the first allowed back out and about when the lockdown restrictions ease.

I can't speak to the public's reaction. I'm guessing if they are sure you've been cleared and you have no symptoms, why should it matter? I mean I wouldn't go around bragging about having had it, but I don't see why there would be a backlash. A lot of people got it without being blatantly irresponsible.

If you recover, you could still be positive (up to 15 days or so, depending on each case). And even if you had it, it doesn´t mean you are "free" to do whatever, because the virus is around and you could pass it over along your hands or something, if you are around people... We all have to be careful for others

No. Viruses don't evolve to become more deadly, typically. The deadly ones die off pretty quickly as they kill their hosts too often or too quickly to spread well.

How about from "mostly asymptomatic and not very contagious" to "more symptomatic and more contagious"?

Wouldn't that be evolutionary advantageous to the virus?

I'm asking as I just had a conversation with someone who was insistent this is a real risk and I felt like I lacked arguments to oppose.

More symptomatic might make a host more likely to stay in bed and not meet meet more people to infect. So it could be more infectious but not get the opportunity to infect more people. It just depends on the details I would think.

I think they are thinking of super bugs and antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Let's say it can evolve. It's not going to evolve overnight. But more importantly, it doesn't need to. It has found a very sweet spot right now. We have no way of curing it or treating it and it's doing a great job of spreading.

The conversation you're having is pointless. It would need to be getting treated to be evolving to avoid treatment. It's a dumb conversation, you see? lol

Sunday evening, my dad started getting chills but really didn’t feel bad other than a little fatigue. His fever get up to 101 through the night. Then yesterday, his fever was a constant 100° but once again, he was only a little fatigued but didn’t feel bad other than that. He even ate 3/4 of a pizza for dinner. Then last night, his fever got up to around 102 but when he woke up this morning, his fever is completely gone and he feels 98% he said. He’s a very healthy and active 53 year old who never gets sick. Is it likely that he had the virus and it’s now gone? Or does he still have it and the symptoms come and go initially? Or does it sound like he just has one of those 48 hour bugs? Any help would be greatly appreciated

Maybe. Impossible to say for sure without a test. But keep an eye on him. If he suddenly gets worse call the emergency services right away. There have been a lot of reports of cases where the symptoms suddenly got far worse after about a week.

I'm in Hollywood, fl and they mandated everyone to wear masks in essential businesses, customers and employees alike. But they're not enforcing really enforcing it. And the owner says we're not honoring that because it will hurt our sales. I don't even feel like going to work anymore, because it's an unsafe work environment. But if i quit or take leave I'll be replaced in a heartbeat. I need the money but i dont want to risk my health for it.

Unemployment Question (Virginia)

I have filed for unemployment since the restaurant I worked at closed because of Covid. They are now trying to open up for take out only, but since I have a pre-existing condition (asthma) I want to continue drawing unemployment and not go back to work. The owners say that opening will not affect anyone’s unemployment if they choose to keep drawing that. But will it? It’s not like the place is closed?

Okay. Here's my problem and maybe someone can help me.

I have mild symptoms of the Covid-19 virus. Because the symptoms are mild the Health Department will NOT give me a test.

Since I have not tested positive, my place of work will NOT give me the two weeks paid time off we are supposed to get if we have Covid-19 because we "have to test positive" to receive those benefits.

I have to test positive for a test I am not being allowed to take.

My boss is telling me I have to "fight for that test."

I am scared because people are being arrested for not self isolating when they're told to do so.

Anyone know what I can do?

I was told the CDC guidelines are people with "mild symptoms" are to just be self-quarantined for "7 days or 3 days after lack of symptoms or fever, whichever is longer. We will not test these individuals to limit the amount of transmission to officials at testing sites as well as transmission to the general public."

So, they purposefully aren't testing people.

If you don’t lockdown and everyone gets the flu, it ends up being worse than the lockdown. Because so many people are sick at once that no one can do their jobs and the hospitals overflow and even more people die. When you lockdown essential businesses continuing functioning and less people die which means there’s less lasting damage to the workforce and economy.

From India

"Apparently, the number of people getting admitted to hospitals for heart attacks and other similar shit has reduced drastically since COVID-19. (Only delivery cases remains unchanged). The number of dead bodies coming in, due to aforementioned cases not getting medical care, have not increased proportionately. What's up with that? Has being quarantined made everyone so chill that the attacks/death caused due to stress, pollution and shit like that have stopped? If so, we need to chill dafuq out after lockdown. Don't work too hard. Don't drink/smoke too much. Chill with the fam. Don't get stuck in traffic (lol)"

The briefings are to provide important information. They aren't supposed to be campaign rallies with propaganda videos meant to boost Trump's image. The networks cut away for that reason most likely.

this is probably an unpopular opinion, but as someone who watched it, having watched this thing unfold the entire time his clip was straight PROPAGANDA. at best it was a poor attempt to spin a narrative. at worst a dangerous misinformation campaign from our highest office to discredit media outlets and push towards full media control. the hannity clip especially was pulled SO out of context it was ridiculous. it was a moment of sarcasm by hannity that was followed by a near month of hannity referring to covid-19 as "the new democratic hoax"

Idk about anyone else but I've personally come to terms with social isolation and everything being closed.

Where I am, places started shutting down mid-March. And never having experienced a provincial or national state of emergency, it was a shock to me and made me miserable.

Tbh I even cried several times because I was mourning my freedom and missed normal life.

But a few weeks have passed. The pandemic is no where near over yet, and I expect the rest of 2020 (especially with the possibilty of a second wave in the fall) and possibly the first couple months of 2021 to be somewhat like this. But I have come to terms with this and learned to accept this new (but thankfully temporary) reality. During this time I have learned a lot about covid-19, pandemics, about viruses in general, and about the importance of cooperation and working together. A special thanks to the daily discussion threads on this subreddit for answering my many questions about these things :)

If anything, I feel somewhat calm now, I've realized that it is what it is, and I'm just gonna keep my mind busy, and am looking forward to the day that WHO declares the pandemic officially over!

Exactly, I'm pretty used to being secluded since I've been that way most of my life due to work/travel. Many others have lived extroverted lives which I understand but just was never for me... I'm sure it takes an emotional toll but I think many like yourself are starting to understand that life isn't just about social interaction but introspection as well.

I don't necessarily promote this guy but he was first google result for what I wanted to convey - We can't control the events in our lives but we can control our reactions to them

What's wrong with reopening businesses while quarantining the high-risk group? There are a lot of hints that CFR is quite a bit lower than the figure we initially thought it would be. (Recent study in Germany showed that it is around 0.37%). That probably means the real CFR for the low-risk group will be even lower. (currently, it's said to be 0.2% for people at 49 or younger so the real figure could be something like 0.05% ?) I am eager to see the Antibody study that is being done in CA and I hope they will publish it based on age group too.

Let's say if we estimate the figure of deaths among the low-risk group and it turns out to be roughly the same as death from flu, does it make sense to open up the businesses and impose shelter in place for only the high-risk group?

My assumption is that if we do the antibody test by age group and find the real CFR for the low-risk group and after that we estimate the death number and only if we find that it's low enough, then we proceed. I am not saying we should do anything before we have that number.

That all depends. If you're asking, is it safe to eat take out food, probably, but obviously it opens up opportunities to get sick. If you're asking if Chick Fil A is safe to eat, no. That shit is bad for your heart and your health.

People are, and mostly it is, yeah. Like I said, by ordering out you're opening up possibilities to get infected, but if you follow some common sense ideas, like throwing out all packaging immediately and washing your hands, and maybe nuking the food for 30-45 seconds in a microwave, you should be fine.

Hello, I’m a researcher at the Teachers College, Columbia University conducting a study examining psychological responses to COVID-19. Our study has been approved by the IRB at my institution (IRB protocol 20-255).

This study is about people’s perceptions of the COVID-19 threat and their psychological reactions and experiences. In this survey, you will be answering questions about your demographics, your perceptions of the COVID-19 threat, your level of psychological distress, and any perceptual disturbances you might be experiencing.

Anyone over 18 years of age and literate in English is eligible to participate in this study. The survey should take about 15 minutes. After completing the questions, we will send out a follow-up survey consisting of the same questions after 3 to 6 months. If you participate in and complete both surveys, you will be entered into a drawing to win one of 5 Amazon gift cards valued at $20.

We will keep the information collected from you as anonymous as possible as we will not be collecting any of your identifiable information except your email in order to contact you for the follow-up survey. All the information collected will be deidentified and your email addresses will be encrypted and used only for the purpose of inviting you to the follow-up survey.

Does anyone in your field expect an uptick in cases once restrictions are loosened? Curious if preparations are made for when we start letting people out freely or if it’s unacceptable to go over daily cases states currently have.

There isn't a Hand Sanitizer Shortage... (and it's Reddit's fault). The only reason you might think otherwise is because you can't find it in mega-retail outlets which are supplied by big industrial manufacturers like Gojo (ie Purell) who can't flex to meet the new demand.

Because of this, a massive upsurge of sanitizer has appeared from smaller skincare companies and yes (you've seen the stories) distilleries and brewers. They have product available. There is no shortage!

HOWEVER: THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL YOU THEY HAVE PRODUCT.

Whaaaaaa??? It's true. Every major online advertising platform (including Reddit) has shut down advertising of "sanitizer" because it's "taking advantage of a crisis" or "price gouging". Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc... all block any mention of sanitizer in ads. So despite a massive supply of hand sanitizer, businesses cannot advertise availability and you're not allowed to know.

Is it Price Gouging if a bottle costs more? While there are certainly terrible examples of price gouging, like the individual who hoarded 17,700 bottles of sanitizer to sell on Amazon... not everyone is doing this. Most are small, legitimate manufacturers who are doing their part to help, and also stay in business during a very tough time.

"But prices are higher!!!" YES, this is true. Prices are higher.... just like prices for a burger are higher at a local restaurant than at a McDonald's. Small operations aren't producing in industrial quantities with industrial efficiencies. The tradeoff is that small businesses are providing services that massive industrials don't, like home delivery. (Ever try to order a single bottle of Purell to your doorstep directly from Gojo?!?!) So, while prices are somewhat higher, it isn't price gouging if they're making the product to fill a need and offer a premium level of service.

People are dying from COVID every hour. Individuals and businesses are hurting badly because of the economic collapse. Sanitizer isn't a cure-all, but it helps and people should know where to find it... Advertising platforms like Reddit aren't responsible for COVID, but they should stop making it worse!

I can empathise with what you're saying. But if only high-priced hand sanitizer is available, that's a sign there is still a shortage. As long as there is a shortage and scalping isn't outlawed nation-wide, middle-men are going to try to resell and create a manufactured shortage. Reducing avenues for re-sale just makes sense for me.

A lot of that increased production, as well, is not going to consumers but directly to people who actually need it (essential workers, including first responders.) The many people who are staying at home right now may want hand sanitizer for convenience but are served just fine by soap and water.

The deaths have been down for two straight days in the US. People would argue that it's the weekend or the easter bro! But the rise in infection and deaths from easter or whatever will not reflect until two three weeks from nos. These are people that have already spent some time in the hospital with the virus. What is the explanation for the drop in deaths? Are we turning the corner?

If you hadn't noticed, a lot of things were shutdown a few weeks ago. The virus can be many things but magic isn't one of them, it can only spread as fast as it's physically able to.

Sweden's ICU new cases look promising, Stockholm is seeing a flattening/decrease of new ICU cases. If we subtract Stockholm, Sweden has lower deaths per capita than our neighbours with stricter lockdown, as Stockholm makes more than 50% of total deaths. Let's hope this trend continues

I understand that "Herd Immunity" occurs when enough individuals have built up a natural immunity to a virus and/or a vaccine has been administered to enough individuals to make everyone immune.

But doesn't it take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine?

If so, what has been responsible, in the past (prior to this year), for relinquishing a seasonal flu virus other than herd immunity without the benefit of a vaccine? Because my understanding of the seasonal flu is that each season it is a new mutation (strain) of an existing virus that creates that season's flu.

So isn't it fair to say that virtually 100% of the time whenever we as a society get over a particular flu in a given year it is because of herd immunity? And a herd immunity without the vaccine component?

Really? Because what I've read of the seasonal flu vaccine is that (1) its effectiveness rate is, at best, 60%; and (2) not enough people in the population take it to effect herd immunity.

So it seems to me that the cycle of seasonal flu that is, year after year, eliminated from our midst is due to herd immunity without much benefit from vaccines...no?

covid19 =/= the flu... there is no way you can compare it. Does the flue give this many hospitalizations in a few months....

The flu vaccine does give immunity to the strain that is most common at that time. Iirc they change it slightly to fit the bill. But the strains change so fast that its not 100% efficient. We are lucky tho that the flu only changes a little bit so the antibosies that are created can also attack the new strain only less efficiently.

Japanese people enjoys the party.

But sad things happend.

It is a pity that Prime minister Shinzo Abe mistakenly believe that as long as he follow the trend, he can get support from Japanese young people.

Japanese people are getting irritated, because their government still don't take effective measures to save poor people and to prevent the spread of COVID19.

The only thing they do is distribute 2 face masks.

(and what is worse, I've not got the masks yet 😭 )

All he has to do is to save citizens, not post meaningless tweet.

As a result, he has seen an angry respose from a lot of Twitter users.

He've got 400k likes and 100k retweets as of today.

This is not "Like" but "the number of hate"

Until a vaccine is developed, nothing is going to end this, except for a massive deployment of tens of millions of rapid result test kits and a robust whole-country contact tracing system. Competent leadership would have started us on this path in January or February at the latest. As far as I can tell, we're still not even started on this path. But they "didn't want the numbers to go up," so we're just waiting for our Easter miracle.

We're just trying to slow the spread, not stop it. Things will reopen in May and Wave 2 of Coronavirus will ravage everyone in the summer. By 2021, vaccines will be deployed. Let's just hope everyone takes it.

The first case in the US was on January 19th. He saw the CDC health alert and sought care. What should have been different if you were the “competent leader”? And all this is easy with hindsight......

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider.*

UV light should kill it, but I wouldn't rely on it for thick material due to it not penetrating very deep. India did recommend people hang their masks in direct sunlight to dry as one way to kill it (after also washing it in soapy water).

Am I an asshole? I like to go jogging a few times a week in my neighborhood. I live in a single family home and run about 2 miles around the adjacent streets heading straight back home. It’s a residential neighborhood in a mid-size city. My city doesn’t require masks at this point but I always wear one when I go to a store (which I do very rarely and always curbside pickup if possible). My neighbors are being really cooperative with social distancing and sidewalks are far from crowded even on a nice day - lots of crossing the street to the other side or moving into the middle of an empty street to avoid each other when we do see another runner or walker.

My friend who lives in Los Angeles shamed me pretty good for not wearing a mask while I run. I really thought I was being safe - probably the closest I come to anyone is about 10ft and that’s normally if someone rides by in the bike lane while I’m on the sidewalk. I’d rather not obstruct my breathing while running but this is the best cardio option available to me and getting outside is saving my sanity. Am I being a selfish jerk?

So low risk just create as much distance as possible by crossing the st or whatever which it sounds like you're already doing. Would wearing a mask reduce risk a tiny bit more... Sure but I don't think its worth it. Your friend in LA is probably forgetting how empty suburban sidewalks are compared to cities.

This crossed my mind as well. She lives in an apartment in a much denser area so I’m sure she would easily encounter 10x the number of people walking around than I generally see when I’m in my neighborhood. Thanks for the response. I’ll keep zig zagging away from everybody for now. Obviously if it’s mandated for any time I leave the house I’ll mask up.

Wanted to ask what you guys think on a particular situation...

My roommate used to smoke cannabis (illegal in our country, but not enforced). Ever since the coronavirus crisis he stopped, because the act of smoking is considered bad in these times (cause of lung damage). He did however say he is considering buying weed to make cannabis butter and make himself some edibles instead, and that got me worried.

I'm worried whether there's an infection risk in buying weed in general, cause the virus might survive on the plant itself, and I don't want my roommate to risk it. Since it is bought illegally, we can't assume proper sanitation and care are kept when handling the buds.

Do you think that if no physical contact is made with the delivery man, and the weed is kept isolated for several days after buying, then there's no risk of any virus traces being left on it?

If I get my roommate to adopt such a protocol is he generally safe?

Mental health has been a major issue. As someone with Depression/Anxiety, I have been losing it in ways that I never have before. My anxiety is the worst it has ever been. It has been suggested to me to take FMLA because there is a very real possibility that I will lose my job due to my mental health functionality while working, but then I won't be able to pay my bills. Department of Labor and Unemployment (AZ) has both told me "I don't know" when it comes to if I could get unemployment while under FMLA due to mental health stress created by COVID-19. Unemployment said "Apply, and then see if it gets accepted". That would be after me cutting off my checks at work?



What protections are there for those with mental health issues exaggerated by COVID-19?

I greatly appreciate it, and offering an ear to someone in my position is certainly a lot to me. I think the most confusing part is speaking with Department of Labor and Unemployment, who both can only tell me "You know, I am not completely sure how that would work."

I am doing what I can, and FMLA is still the last thing I want to do, even if it ends up being the best thing for me. I cannot take that step without knowing that I can be financially secure in some capacity. I don't leave the house, but I have worked with my doctor to start telehealth therapy sessions with him. He will be a great guide for me as well. His education is always of great benefit to me, and I value him for both his ear and his knowledge when it comes to mental health.

I know this isn't going to happen for a while, but when will stay at home orders start to be relaxed? We've been under a stay at home order in CA for a month and my biggest fear is that we will remove the order too soon.

I don't think you have any protection here regarding unemployment benefits unless you can get a letter from your boyfriend's doctor stating that he is high risk and that members of his household require minimal contact with the public. Without that, it looks like you unilaterally took it upon yourself to refuse to work your job based on zero medical advice.

I'm not sure about the backpay though. If the owner himself closed the business it sounds like you shouldn't be having to pay back out for that. You might want to try r/legaladvice

Personally, I go out early in the morning when I take the dog to the dog park and when I go into the store with latex gloves and an N95. I keep my trips short, avoid people, and use self-checkout. So far, so good.

There are many studies proving beyond a reasonable doubt that N95/P2, N100/P3 offer good protection against viruses of this size. Surgical masks offer some (but less) protection.

N95s are technically respirators, not masks. Supposed to help prevent you from getting it as well so long as you follow good protocols like: proper fit, do not adjust or take off till out of the danger zone, do not touch your face, etc.

deliver would be safest, because you don´t need to leave home. You would need to desinfect all the products too, but at least you avoid going to the supermarket. I don´t know if where you live is available or not, in some places is not anymore. Take care!

What about people on Social Security? People on Social Security — both retirees and those on disability — are eligible to receive the coronavirus relief payment as long as their total income does not exceed the limit. Treasury has clarified that people on Social Security who do not normally file a tax return will automatically receive the payment. They do not need to file anything else.

I honestly can't tell. I found conflicting information out there. Don't make any plans to have the money. Wait and see I guess.

If you are claimed as a dependent it says no, if you get ssi, it says yes.

I wonder if the pastors are actually just really worried that if they don’t keep coming, people might realize over time they DON’T need to go to church anymore and they lose their power?

1 months w/o church, 3, 6 etc

Longer they don’t go to church, harder it might be to get them back

That would make the most sense

supply and demand could also work into this argument. if 99% cancel, then 1% can gain all the people who don't want to cancel. maybe they will join and stay?

Why not Self-Selective Quarantine?

Why not focus resources on protecting at risk individuals, like elderly in retirement homes, and at risk individuals at home and allow the general population under 50 or 40 or what have you return to normal function?

Would it not be an effective measure to allow those at most risk to:

A) Protect themselves

and

B) Have the focused help of aids/resources



Wouldn't this also serve to speed up heard immunity?

The idea is fine, but how do you do that? I mean, will you separate families all around the world/country? how do exactly isolate the old people if they need help from "outside" in their homes/retirement homes? how do you avoid people going to hospitals that need daily treatments? I mean, i find it really really hard. In fact, a lot of deaths are in retirements homes, not because they went out, but because their helpers brought the virus in :/

So how do you exaclty manage that in practise? I mean, for instance, you work in a retirement home. Can you go back home after work if you live with your kid and your mother for instance? are you away from them and just stay inside the retirement home for few months? The same for all health care workers, right? I mean, that wouldn´t even be legal I guess...

speeding up herd immunity means overfilling our hospitals. also, keep in mind that anyone you quarantine needs supplies, medical care, and food given by others. they will occasionally call ambulances and fire trucks as well. they will have pipes bust or dryers break. the more people who are exposed to more people the higher the chances those small interactions will become major illnesses

I heard a interview where they talked about this, and I believe it was the UK that thought about it as an option, but realised it is really hard to actually implement a system where the vulnerable are quarantined while the general public goes about its life and spreads the virus. It will still get into the vulnerable populations easily and we overload the healthcare system yada yada.

When we get this outbreak under control we will surely be using resources to protect vulnerable people (as we are now) but we can't just expect them to be safe while it's spreads uncontrollably through the rest of the population.

The point of these masks are to seal your face off from the outside, blocking 95% of all particles. Having a breathing hole anywhere defeats the purpose.

Is the loss of taste and smell unique to covid-19???

Feb 28th I have a tickle in my throat. Feb 29th am I am feverish and coughing mildly. March 1st pm I "lost" my sense of taste and smell. I think I got it back around March 5th but never made a physical note of it. I was not congested, and I know what lack of smell/taste from congestion feels like. I did have contact with recent international travelers in the weeks leading up to my illness.

I could still taste the basic sweet/salty sort of taste but nothing more than that. Like my favorite diet cherry pop just tasted like off sparkling water. An apple just tasted sweet and a little sour, but not apple-y. I don't remember smelling anything during this time, but I also didn't really think about that.

If I had covid-19 I would have been infected 3 weeks before the first case in my area. Well over 1 month before the first case of community transmission. I assumed it was impossible for me to have caught it--and I didn't have that bad of a cough and no shortness of breath anyways. Testing wasn't even available for non-travelers then so I never even tried.

Is there any other type of sickness or cold or flu that could cause this?

I don't even know, from experience my three sinusitis had a temporary blockage then it went away but I couldn't smell or taste for some time.

category of ailment who has Ageusia and anosmia that are more in line with your request.

Upper respiratory infection,Sinus infection,Allergies,Ear infection. Just those represent alot of possible virus and bacteria infection. I am no expert so I can't list everything.

Epidemiologists are now thinking it’s possible that unknown covid19 cases were entering the USA via international travellers earlier than they first thought. The existence of the tiny percentage of asymptomatic ‘supercarriers’ who have been shedding virus for over 2 months makes this at least empirically possible.

Many sicknesses and flus can cause loss of taste/smell with mild coughing and fever. One way to know for sure if you had it will be with an antibody test. Considering you had contact with recent international travelers, it's possible you were infected in late February.

Our reality usually feels really solid. But this pandemic has shown me that things can fall apart surprisingly fast. Will the modest pension that keeps a rented roof over my head hold up? Hope so. Many, many people in way worse situations than me. What else can we do but hope for the best.

Question: why isn't my county in Georgia required to report deaths from Corona? The surrounding counties do. We're at 50 something cases; isn't it likely there's been at least one death?

I'm using the weather channel's Covid19 interactive map.

Edit... So WC's map is crap. Don't recommend it.

Downvote me and hate me all you want, I won’t be following any more stay at homes past May 1st! Come then, if the job I have isn’t back (one I like) I will be heading to start earning my CDL to drive locally while this happens. I’m not staying inside longer than May 1st eating through all my savings. I’ll be patient till May 1st. I’d consider two months of quarantine enough time that we can be selfish again. 200k deaths vs 10s of millions not working and dying out slowly from all factors associated with a Great Depression.

May 1st!! Then I’m out this door earning money. Just won’t visit my parents or grandparents for awhile

You're assuming people have got their government checks. from what I'm reading in the United States that's few and far between.

So those people staying home either of put themselves in that position by having a security blanket, or they are burning what meagre savings they have trying to keep this from being a bigger outbreak than it already is.

I bet you're the type of person that believes that the number is being displayed now proved that the outbreak wasn't a big deal. With zero consideration of why the numbers are trending way lower.

Current bank account says we have a pending transaction for $2400 set to complete on Wednesday 4/15. We filed in 2018 and 2019 and used direct deposit as the preferred method. Considering this year's return we got only $9 back, this stimulus is just too sweet.

This scares me because if we do the right thing the "it's a hoax" and "we are overreacting" crowd will feel vindicated.

How do we convince the 50 percent of people that think this way that it's wrong?

We're getting it up here in Canada. I have to express the people almost everyday the only reason the numbers are doing so well is the fact that so many people are engaging into active mitigation efforts.

Our leaders up here are saying it's probably going to be more than a year to see a semblance of normalcy. Reopen too fast and you give the virus exactly what it needs.

Our federal leaders here in the states are saying we might open stuff up May 1st! 🤦🏼‍♂️ No discussion really about after that. Many states are getting good info from local leaders though.

In America we are so partisan...telling people that we are flattening the curve because of mitigation falls on deaf ears most of the time. Will Canada make an exception and open the border for me? I live a few hours away!

i don´t know what "long run means" for you in this context. Mid -term is clear that this will be very bad for economy everywhere pretty much. It got to the point to decide between bad or worse, pretty much.

You are right that the economic pain will be long and painful in ways equal and worse to the pandemic. I don't think you are a monster and it's a good point to bring up. Living in fear of the virus at the expense of mental health and economic well being can cause more harm than good. People that are calling for a lockdown till the end of the year are wrong....the economy has to open back up at some point or we see more pain and suffering.

However, we crossed a point in late February where a lockdown was inevitable. Every state has restrictions because if they didn't we would have a terrifying health care overload. (Due to exponential virus growth) At that point states have no option but to shut down anyways. Even if they don't shutdown the economy is ruined due to everyone's fear of the virus.

We could take the approach the UK was going to take and just let it run its course and try and isolate the vulnerable..... but isolating the vulnerable is much harder than it sounds. When everyone sees their father or grandma being denied care and dying we are probably right back at square one.

The virus is winning right now and we are using our last line of defense to stop it.

I am heartened to hear that some sense has came to this thread today. Virus will only stop with herd immunity and long term shutdowns will be more detrimental than the virus. It's a hard but important truth to understand! Contact tracing is no longer viable as the virus is worldwide.

So do we stay under quarantine forever?? When will it be 'safe' to venture outside. Or once economy is totally destroyed, everyone will say f*** it and get in bread and soup line as starvation will overcome fear of virus? People die every day. YTD more people died from flu complications or medical mistakes or hospital acquired infections than from the virus.
How long a bread line has to get before we come to our senses and do a smart targeted quarantine (nursing homes, no concerts etc.). All we are doing right now is, to make analogy, using a sledgehammer to kill a fly in the house. Will get the job done but what a mess.

And don't anyone talk about wide spread mandatory testing. We don't do that for STIs that kill. HIV anyone? Quarantine for all HIV positives?

How are we even going to keep supply lines open, workers in agriculture, warehouses, meat processors are getting sick and panicking. And the employers don't even provide SOAP in some cases.

In fact the administration is now trying to lower minimum wage for agricultural workers lol.

To your first question, I'll quote you:

Just Google it. Too lazy?

To your second, I'm not qualified to make those sorts of predictions, so I'd default to people who are experts in this area. I think we do know though that if we just get back to normal, obviously the virus will continue to spread, and most will be fine, but the increased numbers of infected will lead to increased numbers of hospitalizations and as we've already seen in certain parts of the world, hospitals will be overwhelmed and in some cases will have to choose who lives or dies. People with unrelated conditions needing help won't be able to get it, etc. Certainly doesn't sound rosy.

Other parts of the world are not US. They already had shit of a health care systems. Italy's was basically bankrupt with huge cuts in care prior to current situation. In USA we have ability to shift resources to places that need it, NYC is perfect example. No one there died because of inability to care for the sick.

Have you lived in other parts of the world and are you qualified to comment on the condition of their health care?

The USA also started lockdowns and social distancing as a preventative, rather than reactionary measure here, so the way things have been going are a result of our efforts. Do you feel that things will stay the same or improve if we stop doing any of these things? Make sure to back up your opinion with proper scientific reasoning.

I've lived in 4 different countries in my life, and while I would agree that the healthcare system in the US is best, that's highly dependent on if you can afford it. Most cannot. People were avoiding getting tested in Feb/March because it was simply too expensive. Those sorts of things are huge problems.

I'm not sure I'd call any of the other countries healthcare offering "shit," though and I still doubt your credentials to say that's why things got bad there. I'd argue that for a period, most people all across the planet weren't taking this seriously, and because of how contagious this virus is, that's why you ended up with large #'s of infected. Regardless of whether or not a countries healthcare is shit or not, this virus is still going to have a % of people that need medical care after contracting it. The issue is that there simply weren't beds, ventilators, etc, for everyone. They were overwhelmed. To that point...

You didn't answer my question. Do you believe that if we go back to normal that conditions will improve throughout the country, and if so, why?

Chicken or the egg my friend. The only reason YTD more people died from the flu or other things you mentioned is because the stay at home orders have been successful. There would be even less death if we had stayed at home earlier. Even with the current measures in place corona is the leading cause of death each day for Americans.

So what you are saying that if someone stays in quarantine for next 6 months, gets out and get infected, they will be fine? Outcome will be different? I don't know that you noticed, but that 'flattened the curve' graph, both high spike and flat have the same area under them. Research what that means.

I don’t understand what your trying to say. Are you saying we have yet to flatten the curve? If so I agree that the curve has not been flattened yet and probably won’t for another month at least of doing what we are doing now. I’m saying deaths and illness would be significantly higher and with worse economic ramifications if we had carried on like this was just another version of the flu.

Let me explain the 'area under the curve'. That basically means that number of infected will be the same over time. We do it slowly or quickly. Outcome to people that are susceptible will be the same, death or no impact.

So you are speculating, making wild assumptions. No evidence even in hotspot like NYC that system was overwhelmed and as a result people died. US healthcare system is very robust, resources (state, military) and be rapidly deployed and shifted where needed.

At some point the lockdown will be removed, but it should be a very gradual process open only for a few key industries and keep applying this while watching the numbers. Almost like reducing patients medicines..

When people say ending the lockdown is putting the economy over public health, can they really not understand that the single greatest factor of a country's overall public health is the ECONOMY?

Sure, we will all be safe from a disease we most likely wouldn't be hospitalized for, or even get, but what happens months from now when we are all broke and can't afford that open heart surgery?

"It's been a little over a decade since the world experienced its last pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. Between the spring of 2009 and the spring of 2010, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people, according to the Centers for Disease Protection and Control. "

killing between 1,517,000 and 5,754,000 would be a pretty big deal

Does anyone know if there are any /r threads or dialogue surrounding #covid19 censorship of artists? I got a line of "CovidCareCards" that I make removed by Etsy, citing "exploitative content." The current policy explicitly bans content related to 'pandemics or natural disasters' so I'm thinking a tornado line of cards would be great too... What's up with this?

---------

Etsy has decided that my CovidCareCards are EXPLOITATIVE of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, every other Etsy user has repurposed their shop to supply cute face masks for $30 a pop at minimum.

In response, I will be sending cards completely free of charge ----- no $ involved at all ----- to anyone, anywhere, who wants one (or five). Just message / e-mail / call / whatever. Feel free to share and tell your friends because all mine already have them coming in the mail.

I partially began making these cards in response to an e-mail that I received from a friend of mine who just spent 4 weeks in the hospital in near total isolation battling COVID-19. I am grateful that he is alive. He sent an e-mail to his entire contacts list after he was back at home and recovering with a request to send cards, greetings, anything to patients, nurses, and front-line workers to help mitigate the very real psychological effects of social distancing and quarantine. He asked that these cards be made out to "anyone" (rather than someone specific) at the local hospital, nursing home, etc.

These also came to be to support my own mental health. Those of you who know me know how much I love sending cards and letters in the mail (many of you already have some coming in your mailbox ) ... Yes, they are always for the sender. But they also help me feel connected, feel grounded, and maintain my own sanity. Cards and letters feel 100000x more real than texts and right now it seems more important than ever to maintain some kind of 'real' connection with one another.

I really just want to brighten people's day and am happy to draw up any design / quote. I'm drowning in cards right now that can't be sold to random strangers on the internet so pick your favorite and it's yours!

(The Upside is that not selling these means that I don't have to feel guilty about the random silver fingerprints and minor booboos because: lefty working with paint pens).

My aunt made an 'order' to her entire Sunday School class for cards that said, "It may have a crown, but Jesus is still King." They were pretty cute "

p.s. - also while I don't really understand why the CovidCareCards were flagged, I do understand the strict blanket policies that ETSY (and other online marketplaces) would apply to keep anyone from even maybe exploiting the current situation for profit. If anyone feels that my cards WERE actually exploitative, please let me hear from you so I can also learn, grow, and do better.

Sure, a sore throat means your throat hurts. It doesn't necessarily mean that it hurts any more when you swallow.

Take it seriously early on instead of waiting for it to become a problem. When your intelligence agencies come to you and say "this is going to happen and it's going to be bad," you start preparing. You start formulating a strategy, you start stocking up on medical gear and equipment, and you start speaking to states. You educate your citizens and prepare them for what's going to happen and what we can all do, instead of saying dumb shit like "it's just a flu," or "it'll go away in April, like a miracle!" or "We have like 10 cases.. soon to be zero," etc.

You know just to start with anyway.

The federal government were working with California in a joint effort on the virus back in January. They seem to be doing pretty well compared others.

the WHO consigned on the Chinese lie that was no human to human contact on January 14th.

Fauci said on the 26th of January that the US didn't need to worry about Corona.

They deleted the question, so you get the reply to "what was the ideal response?"

Last summer we don't fire the epidemic monitoring office from the CDC that lived and worked in China, a trusted apolitical partner embedded in China's public health system. They're dispatched to Hubei, are standing there when the hospital is overwhelmed with cases of a novel SARS that infects the healthcare workers before Christmas. Epidemiologist gets on the phone to DC screaming "Shut! Down! Everything!" DC declines. Epidemiologist goes on media tour.

This is a crisis of historic proportions. If we lose containment in China this will blanket the world and millions will die. The politicians trying to cover it up are going to be responsible for the deaths.

World governments go into crisis control by New Year's day, shut travel before Chinese New Year diaspora. Fever checks and mandatory traveller quarantine both outbound and inbound everywhere in the world. China cracks down, shutting Hubei before the virus escapes. Spread through the province is minimal, in the test of China almost non-existent. Wuhan gets the worst of it, and is locked down 80 days.

Global cases before containment: <10,000, only a few outside China. Deaths <1,000, all in Wuhan.

Virus goes extinct, everything except global travel is unaffected. Global travel returns to normal by June.

Any healthcare management folks here? Is it safe to assume that elective procedures are pretty much paused until a treatment or vaccine is available?

I'm a nurse not a manager, I'm guessing if hospital pass crisis mode they might eventually open up some room for the more urgent cases, the elective cases are the most profitable and I don't think hospitals can financially wait that long unless they get bailed.

Not at all. In Colorado they are starting to schedule for June procedures. People who need surgeries can’t wait months to years for surgeries.

Highly unlikely. In the US, hospitals rely on elective procedures to generate revenue. They are hemorrhaging money right now. They won't wait months/years to start back up.

It is entirely dependent on where you are though. In NY, elective procedures are cancelled by Executive Order. It will be up to Cuomo to determine when those restrictions ease, which likely won't be for another month at least.

Los Angeles resident here, I have a question regarding events that would take place if the virus stops spreading in the summer. I bought tickets for Anime Expo on my birthday in early February and it seems like they aren't really thinking too much of cancelling this year. While I'm hoping that everyone in L.A. would be able to slow the spread of the virus, How would the virus still be (hopefully not) be around summertime. It will be be my first con going and I know that my health and everyone else's health in the L.A. area is the first thing to be put in our mind, I'm just curious if AX would just cancel the event at this point even with the extend lockdown up until may 15

No one actually knows what it will be like in the summer. I would assume if its anywhere near the beginning of the summer, there's almost no chance it even happens.

There is a 0% chance anime expo is happening this year. I'm guessing newsom will make that official today when they announce the path to reopening. Conventions aren't happening before there is a major change in our ability to treat this.

I think there will be a second and third wave of covid19 lasting 18 months. If you book tickets and spend money on events that end up being cancelled you will not get your money back.

Ask them today, and from now on ask about refunds in case of cancellation due to isolation, quarantine, and public health orders before you book anything. There could be unscrupulous operators out there deliberately taking monies for events they have no intention of putting on and then blaming the pandemic for there being no refunds.

I want people in general to defy Trump, buuuuut this isn't really Fauci's job. It's disappointing when he gets up there and praises Trump, as if he's done anything at all that could be considered good in regards to our current situation. Imagine the frustration any adult has to be feeling trying to do their job during all of this, knowing that they also have to navigate Trump's fagile ego and not upset him.

The country needs Fauci, so I guess he has to play politics here, and given that that's our reality, I guess I want him to continue.

But I sure do hope he's got it in him to write a book after all this, or do some revealing interviews, so everyone can know just how god damned ridiculous the whole thing was.

He’s a professional. He’s done his job diligently for decades. Men with that conviction are few and far between. Regardless of his own beliefs, he willingly participates in this and his goal is the same as Trumps. It takes no medical knowledge to see that his involvement is more helpful to the country than his quitting. He isn’t a politician but much of what he says can be misquoted and misconstrued to fit a typical political agenda, and he has made it clear he hates that.

Someone help me understand the end game of the social distancing. As it stands now in all states we have <.1% confirmed cases. With those numbers how can we ever “reopen” the country. There really are only 2 paths we can take at this point.

With such low numbers, we have to conclude that social distancing was TOO effective. If NYC was overwhelmed with the vast majority of the population inside, what will happen when we lift the restrictions? It appears all we did was push the spike out to whenever we “reopen” the country. These spikes weren’t actually the spikes we were afraid of. The problem is we pushed the spike out, but we didn’t really gain much. We don’t have a vaccine, we don’t have treatments, we don’t even have proven medical masks for every citizen. So at this point, you will need to enforce social distancing until there one of the above. Which will either be years out or never. Otherwise we will have millions of people dying in the near future just in the United States.

You admit those numbers of <.1% are extremely underreported and millions of Americans have/had COVID-19. You can’t have it both way. It can’t be incredibly dangerous/contagious with some states having <20 deaths at the “peak”, unless point 1 is true. So at this point you lift most social restrictions and let people live their life’s. Thousands may die, but most will develop immunity.

So it really boils down to either we are going to be in lockdown for a year+ or we realize it isn’t as serious as originally thought and we endure some deaths for herd immunity. Logic says the latter is going to be what happens very very soon here.

You have to consider the implications of fast spread of the virus. Not only would hospitals be so overwhelmed that people would die without even getting in, many more doctors and nurses would die, slowing things down even more. There are already hundreds of doctors and nurses that are sick and dying. Yeah, I get you don’t like being at home, but please consider the lives of people who have to deal with the effects of your freedom.

Of course not.

The alternative is getting masks for everyone, and I mean real masks not homemade pieces of cloth. Social distancing will need to stay in place to an extent. The lockdown needs to lift eventually, but we'll still need to social distance as much as possible until a vaccine is developed. That will look different for each person depending on their situation. Anyone who can work from home should continue to do so for as long as possible.

Completely lifting everything would be catastrophic. We can't get into a "let the weak die" mentality or things will snowball into hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US alone.

So exactly like I said, option #1. That’s months out though. Do you envision the public going for that? I do not. We are just supposed to shut everyone inside (and from outside the country) for months? We have 16m unemployed after less than a month and you’re talking many months.

Every major policy decision causes a chain of events that leads to some people’s deaths, the butterfly effect makes that inevitable. Any decision that governments make at this point is going to result in some people dying who would not have died if the government had taken a different approach.

As blunt as this sounds, a vague statement that “some people will lose their loved ones” is not a substantial argument against an approach you disagree with in this situation.

Depressions, which are like 10x worse than recessions, are kind of like a “lolbye poor people, nice knowing ya” type scenario, depressions cause society to collapse and that’s why the Great Depression lasted over a decade and the Great Recession lasted less than 2 years.

Recessions are mild enough that their effects are mostly limited to the economy, depressions cause all-consuming social unrest. If a depression is possible, we need to start taking measures to avoid it, because with a depression we could be looking at a decade of life basically being a living hell for a lot of people.

I don't think anyone's really advocating for lifting all lockdowns and social distancing. For one thing, no matter what happens, the most at-risk people should remain locked down as much as possible. Businesses should operate with protective gear as well as customers. Whether people like it or not, this has to happen.

From the CDC:

US Coronavirus deaths in TWO MONTHS: 22,109

Do you now see how using the flu as an argument that coronavirus can be ignored is asinine? In a few days the US will have more coronavirus deaths in less than two months than all of the flu deaths in 2019...

Because the flu kills a much smaller number of people over a much longer period of time. It doesn't make sense to do that for the flu.

With no social distancing and everyone doing normal things 34k people with the flu died last year. With a global lockdown in effect 22k people have died in two months.

I dont understand how you don't see the difference between the two.

This will be hard to hear but face reality. We can’t save everyone. No matter what we do, people will die. Loved ones will die.

Do we plunge 200 million people into a prolonged economic depression to save lives from coronavirus? Will that kill more people than we save? There is no moral answer here. This “loved ones dying for the economy” appeal-to-emotion is ridiculous.

It is a shame that we can’t run a simulation showing how bad the economic fallout of herd immunity approach is. Not only do you have more death, you have worse economic fallout too. It’s lose lose, but people too dumb to realize how stupid they are are incapable of ever realizing that.

How can someone not be a fan of Fauci? The guy has literally chosen a professional dedicated to helping others. He's 79 years old - most of us hope to be retired by then and yet he's barely sleeping because he's constantly dealing with all of this, and he's working for arguably the biggest asshole on the planet.

The man's a saint.

Unpopular opinion: The US response to the pandemic was actually very fast.

Before you get angry and try to fight me, hear me out.

to give some context: I came back to California on an empty plane (10 people) from Korea (w/ China layover) morning of Feb 5th. Which means im that 0.01% of people coming in from china/korea that could give this firsthand account.

When I arrived to the airport morning of Feb 5, they had quarantined us, interviewed us, and taken our temperatures. We were given orders and a form to track ourselves for 2 weeks, and report anything out of normal to them. This was done to us even before the USA had their first case.

Later that same day was when the first ever covid case in the US was confirmed.

I was afraid of my plane having to turn back, because even that early on, the U.S was known to have been rejecting incoming flights from asia.

I work in event planning, and I curate tons of events at venues and centers. 90% of my events cancelled by Feb 15-21, because of govt orders, and by that time, only a little more than a dozen covid cases in the US.

I think we as a nation of people are to blame. We were the type of people to laugh at mask and glove wearers. Now, by wearing masks, we just caught up with the program.

people are saying there was no response in the entire month of Feb, and a horrible response in march but this is not my experience.

TLDR: I experienced firsthand response and instructions, even during a time when we had no cases.

Quick google gave me this:

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider.

I wonder if the discrepancy is because of when he entered vs when he was confirmed? I couldn't remember exactly in my comment this morning, didn't do a double check, but it was definitely on US soil in January.

Thanks for that. Perhaps then the Feb 5 one was when they finally tested to show the virus in someone and not based on medical diagnosis of symptoms. Shrug

And yet I have dozens of reports of people coming back from Italy, France and Spain just before the closing of flights and receiving no screening, no quarantine information. I know of one person that came Beijing through to LAX on their way to Buffalo. Regularly scheduled monthly travel, did it in December January and February and not stopped a single time.

I do agree that this is a people problem. Even in Canada mask acceptance can be low, you'll get ete rolls for trying to protect yourself and your family from exposure.

If you're basing your entire opinion on the US response by your 1 flight, you're pretty bad at forming opinions.

I’m kind of blown away that anyone thinks anything will ever “return to normal” not that this is the apocalypse but the USA is clearly ramping up for a bloodbath and everyone seems to be trying to convince themselves everything is already fine. Which makes no sense.

For example COVID19 deaths are up, not down. And they’re going to keep going up, not down, for a good while. We will probably hit 3500 dead sometime this week? Why is everyone obsessed with going to a bar or whatever? Don’t they realize that sort of thing isn’t worth risking your life?

This is very confusing. I have friends in Wuhan and they are extremely distressed by everything I tell them about what’s happening in America. They say this is absolutely horrifying. I feel like this virus has exposed some deep chasm in American culture that reveals we really do value our personal opinions more than the lives of others, and that we did this to ourselves. America can blame no one but Americans for their current (and future) predicament. They simply don’t care about reality.

For example I am looking at the news and they keep showing celebrations of individual people (heroes) being released from the hospital after recovering from COVID19 and all I can see is that 8 out of 10 people in every one of these videos is potentially infecting themselves with COVID19. Why? To tell a neighbor you’re happy he’s not dead? He’s probably not even lucid right now. That sort of thing can wait.

Anyway, there’s this performative thing I see going on. Most people typically view themselves as the protagonist of their own stories and align themselves with a reality in which they are the hero. I happen to be a hero who was bad at life but excellent in crisis situations so my narrative remains unchanged but other people seem to be casting themselves as invincible or victims of an overly elaborate Truman Show media conspiracy hoax.

Anyway there won’t be normal because our whole economy is about to be completely realigned. Things will be different. A lot of industries will go away for a good decade.

I agree with most of your points. But, you lack some of the optimism that makes America special and unique. It’s true some have gone the path of delusional optimism, or simply fear they won’t be able to work anymore if the lockdown persists.

But I think there are potential paths forward. These paths bring their own risks, but they all start with widespread, thorough testing. A group a Mt Sinai in NYC has developed a serum test that is more sensitive and more accurate than the PCR test. They’ve made the protocol freely available. The nice thing is the testing does not involve live virus and therefore does not require very high level safety protocols and equipment in the testing laboratories. Labs across the country will start using this test. I’ll be in one of those labs. We’re developing it starting this week. We should be able to make enough tests for the entire state and it should take about a month to get those tests ready. The cool thing about this test is it can tell if you’ve previously had COVID and are now immune and safe to go back to work.

There is a risk in this kind of surveillance testing. You don’t want to incentivize people to contract COVID. But maybe if we start to open the economy simultaneously with this test, we can ID people at work who should still have the masks and those who are already immune and don’t need to worry anymore. I’m not a policy guy, but that’s how I would do this. Maybe those who don’t have immunity get tested monthly, or just get tested when they get sick with any respiratory illness. Then they would know if it’s time to lose the mask. I don’t know. I’m just kind of brainstorming.

I take my shoes off in our entry way when we get home from going out. If I walk in the entryway barefoot two days after the last time we came home, but don’t touch my shoes, is it likely it would go from the floor to my feet?

Very (very) unlikely. Besides, if it´s on the floor, you won´t be infected by your skin anyway. You would have to bring your feet to your face and contact with your mouth, nose or eyes.

It’s really not low mortality, in fact it’s higher mortality rate than Spanish Flu the last time I checked. We don’t know who’s vulnerable because it can harm any age group, not just the elderly or higher risk people. You’ll probably get your wish anyways because apparently the economy and money is more important than peoples lives.

I’m not trying to make things political but I hope I can get an ELI5 on this:

Why aren’t the state governments of New York and New Jersey getting more blame? Combined they have close to half of the country’s cases yet I haven’t really heard anything negative about how their government has handled things

There was a good amount of bitching at the Mayor of NYC for not closing schools earlier.

State colleges closed around a week before the city colleges did. And city colleges are the poor kids that all take the subway.

Governor told Mayor to close streets down for more pedestrian traffic and he did like the bare minimum possible TWO BLOCKS.

generally the blame comes after the crisis is over

but in general, what percentage of cases per 100k did they have on the day of decisions versus the day of decision for other places? that would determine if they were fast enough. they can't fix the 2 week lag time for each choice except to build more hospitals

My SO is the DON at a private pay assisted facility. One of the nurses tested positive Thursday and 2 more are now home with fevers. I want to support her but also want to know if I should isolate in another apartment we have for a while or if since we live together the thought would be that we already have been too exposed to one another for this to matter now? If you have a minute let me know your thoughts. SO currently has no symptoms. Stay safe and good luck to us all.

if you're still working and going out, it would definitely be better to separate yourself from her, just as a precaution. But if you're hunkered down and don't have any pre-existing conditions it's really your choice whether you're willing to roll the dice or not. The huge problem right now is that there's a bottleneck in testing. Ideally every single patient and nurse at that assisted facility should be tested and re-tested, so that only COVID-negatives remain. But we're not at that point, and sadly I don't think this country will ever be.

My concern is catching it myself in this scenario honestly. Part of me thinks I have been around her everyday so far....and the other thinks that just because I have been doesn't mean I have been exposed yet and if so I should avoid too much contact. With a frosting on top of not wanting her to have to be alone.... What a time we live in.

They believe their constituTional rights are infringed on.

One really doesn’t like the Amy lady making guidelines for restrictions.

Others believe this virus is just whatever and not that serious.

Lastly I saw a few people with signs saying lockdown kills just as many people.

Edit: One lady didn’t like that the grocery store hounds people about staying 6 feet apart but abortion clinics are still open and essential.

Seems like a cluster of people out there for a whole different reasons.

This "doomer vs bloomer" mentality is making it that much harder to make sense of statements being made by public officials. Is the US/DC area likely to get an "open up" instruction from the Feds? I'm seeing the same interviews be spun both directions and it is confusing.

Yes. Trump tweeted earlier to clear up the confusion and conflict of “fake news”. He said he holds the authority to open up all the states, and will work closely with governors. He said the decision will be made by him in conjunction with the governors and others.

Edit: Thanks for downvotes everyone. I understand your deep hate for one person but I am only relaying information. Also thanks for providing any insightful input...

Articles like this one irritate me when they say things like, "There a lot of unknowns about transmission" of this virus.

Am I wrong in thinking that we've had decades of knowledge about how infectious diseases a) have incubation periods in the body before symptoms develop and b) that they can spread while symptomatic and that we should assume that the same holds true here based on what we HAVE seen so far?

You can make an assumption, but until it is determined by scientific study as it relates to this virus it is still "unknown".

There are definitely unusual aspects about this virus that are not the norm in terms of transmission, so I would be wary about relying on assumptions tbh.

Well, while I agree with your first statement, maybe what I'm trying to highlight is that since we know this is far more intense than what we've normally seen, we should be acting accordingly and assume that it's at least going to have similar characteristics (an incubation period, high transmission rate, and a fatality rate that is at least as much as we've seen with the known infectious illnesses.)

Apologies I wasn’t trying to discuss theories I was just trying to vent, there was a reason I was being vague. I’ve been dealing with a ton of people posting theories. I really honestly wasn’t trying to discuss it I’m just frustrated by the ignorance I keep seeing.

I was trying to see if any studies were being done using genetian violet for coronavirus treatment but there doesn’t seem to be any . I can’t see why they wouldn’t try this !

What if you see someone lugging groceries back home, and then their bag rips and their groceries fall out? Would you go to help them, or would you not because "6 foot distance oh no can't go near you sorry you're f***ed for help on your groceries"?

Hi people

I've just read the abstract of an article that says medicinal smoke can kill bacteria. So it got me wondering if we can disinfect our homes and lungs with medicinal smoke. What do you guys think?

The article: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17913417/

Apart from it being bad to breath hot gases into your lungs, this is a virus, so things that kill bacteria don't work on it.

What’s the latest on ivermectin? I know normally it is a chloride channel blocker for scabies but I read somewhere that it inhibits viral entry into the nucleus. Plus a few docs I believe have tried it on patients of which they said that those who were not rapidly deteriorating and on fi02 < 50 had significant improvement after drug administration. I think this also points to the fact that interventions need to be taken immediately. Waiting until patients are hospitalized and very sick before providing intervention is hurting people’s chance of survival. Early intervention seems key.

Well the side effects are well tolerated and I know normally we’d want a double blind placebo controlled study to figure this stuff out but I think at this point the threshold for trying new well tolerated meds should be lowered to save the most lives.

I had plans of starting a daily journal of the number of cases and deaths we'd see every day in the world. After two days, I quit due to panic attacks. Here are those two days:

3/13/2020 - 4:15AM

Total Confirmed Cases: 128,343

Total Deaths: 4,720

Total Recovered: 68,324

Recovery Rate: 53.23%

Death Rate: 3.67%

__________________________________
3/14/2020 - 4:41AM

Total Confirmed Cases: 145,374 (up 17,031)

Total Deaths: 5,429 (up 709)

Total Recovered: 71,712 (up 3,388)

Recovery Rate: 49.32% (down 3.91%)

Death Rate: 3.73% (up 0.06%)

____________________________________

It's crazy that just one month ago, the world was sitting at 145,374 cases with the majority of those being from China. Now, as we're close to 2,000,000, these stats give me an eerie feeling.

Not necessarily past the peak, most likely we are flattening, but best guess for r0 right now is 1.3 which would means we haven't reached peak yet, unfortunately.

Saw a dailymail article that said that the economic shutdown could last as much as 18 months. While I understand dailymail isn’t exactly reliable all the time, I do wonder how long the economy shut down for the 1918 pandemic? Like was it continuous or in waves and for how long. I can’t seem to find anything on that.

They didn't shut down, that's why so many died.

You can read DC and NYC newspapers from back then, churches closed for a month or so but only once.

Is there an ELI5 that explains why the pneumonia deaths and flu deaths have decreased significantly - and all seeming lumped as covid-19.

I don't believe this to be the case and do believe I read an explanation, but could use a refresher.

I see this as a talking point for a reason covid numbers could be artifically inflated and was hoping for some clarity here.

Thanks

Not trying to push anything.

I've seen conservative talking points pointing towards the number of flu deaths and pneumonia deaths being reported has dropped dramatically. Essentially saying that those that could have died from flu or pneumonia, are just being lumped in as covid-19....thus making it seem more deadly than it is.

With pneumonia being a complication from covid, unless tested and with ability to "presume it was covid" - how the hell does anyone know the difference?

Like I said, I don't believe anyone to be inflating the numbers - not wearing a tinfoil hat, just looking for an explanation.

why the pneumonia deaths and flu deaths have decreased significantly

The people susceptible to death by flu and pneumonia are far more likely to die from coronavirus. So if 100 people were supposed to die from the flu, coronavirus kills them instead. So flu numbers will be down.

I'm not sure what data you're getting this from. We would expect pneumonia and flu deaths to decline when people are washing their hands and doing social distancing. But in the datasets I've seen, deaths from pneumonia and cardiac arrest (a possible COVID-19 cause of death) increased by far more than flu deaths decreased.

Increase in year over year all-cause mortality is probably a good indicator to be looking at here.

it makes sense. i was driving home last night listening to some conservative radio talk show host who kept repeating the narrative that hospitals are given 39k incentive for corona deaths while receiving nothing for non corona, leading them to say hospitals everywhere are falsely inflating and attributing corona deaths to get fed money, and that in reality this whole thing is just a mild flu.

Hmm, I wonder if this news host is based in CT, that figure's the same as CT hospitals' COVID-19 stimulus.

Hospitals are being given funds to pay for uninsured COVID-19 patients, but it's not distributed by their reported cases, it's distributed by their historical Medicare billings. Medicare and insurers also pay by procedure, not diagnosis. So hospitals aren't making any money right now by reporting COVID-19 cases. A cynic could say that they would over-report in hopes of receiving future stimulus funds, but hospitals make most of their money on elective procedures. During the reaction to COVID-19, they can't do that, and actually many hospitals are losing money right now.

So I don't think this talk show host's theory is grounded in facts.

Japanese people enjoys the party.

But sad things happend.

It is a pity that Prime minister Shinzo Abe mistakenly believe that as long as he follow the trend, he can get support from Japanese young people.

Japanese people are getting irritated, because their government still don't take effective measures to save poor people and to prevent the spread of COVID19.

The only thing they do is distribute 2 face masks.

(and what is worse, I've not got the masks yet 😭 )

All he has to do is to save citizens, not post meaningless tweet.

As a result, he has seen an angry respose from a lot of Twitter users.

He've got 400k likes and 100k retweets as of today.

This is not "Like" but "the number of hate"

Controversial opinion. Except for certain circumstances, I have absolutely NO sympathy for any of these people trying to cancel their flights/vacation plans. People were aware of COVID-19 since end of 2019 and was informed that it was spreading and was deadly in Jan 2020. Even when things got more serious into Feb 2020, people took advantage of this for "cheap flights" and continued on their vacations as if they were the only invincible ones. If you hadn't cancelled your vacation by Dec 2019 and are complaining now, just take it as an expensive lesson.

We planned a vacation in February for the end of April to another part of the states. I honestly thought it would be over, or not really spread that much by then. We didn't book anything that wasn't refundable. It was a very short weekend between go ahead and book it, to cancel it.

I agree. I think it was early Feb when China was starting to shut things down as lunar new year approached.

If you were still making plans for the coming weeks/months that involved traveling out of the country, then you knew the risk you were taking.

Zero sympathy. I'll save that for the people who have lost jobs / income through no fault of their own in these past few weeks and the many months ahead.

I mean I made reservations in Feb for end of March (no down payments) and we really didn’t know it was going to be this bad. We kept saying let’s wait and see, but by the second week we cancelled. Remember they downplayed everything for a long while 😞 BUT I do agree that ppl shouldn’t have jumped on lower cost flights

How does flattening the curve work and where is the evidence? The average flue kills more people than this will (Bill Bennett) so this is all an over reaction? Media is blowing this out of proportion and it isn't a pandemic.

These are just a few of the things I hear on a daily basis from my, watches fox 8 hours a day, father in America.
I'm trying to educate myself as much as I can but there is an overwhelming amount of information and I find it difficult to locate sources to formulate an educated stance on the matter.

Can anyone help with their reputable facts, journals, and studies?

I believe it is self-evident.

If social distancing doesn't prevent infections overall, it will at least slow them down (i.e., "flatten the curve").

"Flattening the curve" is important because it relieves the strain on healthcare resources. It's possible that social distancing may not have an effect on the overall number of people who get infected. But it will spread out those cases over time.

Let's say a 100-bed hospital can admit 100 patients and discharges the same amount per week. If the surrounding population will end up with 1,000 people infected one way or another, it is better to have those 1,000 cases spread out over a period of 10 weeks. Without social distancing to slow the spread, that hospital could have all 1,000 show up in the same week.

If the hospital doesn't have enough resources to treat the critical patients, more people will die. This is what happened in Northern Italy, and what we are trying to avoid.

It's a simple concept, people stay at home side and obviously they will be physically interacting with less people than if they weren't at home. The less people are in physical contact with one another, the less opportunity the virus has to spread. It can't spread magically via the internet, you need to be in person to spread in.

Expected mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 1% (you can just Google this and find plenty of sources to back it up). The season flu is around 0.1%. So just on mortality rate alone COVID-19 is 10 times deadlier than the flu. The next important number is the R0, how contagious the virus is. R0 represents how many people one person will spread the virus to. The flu has a R0 of 1.3, where as SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have a R0 upwards of 5.6.

To sum it up, coronavirus is both deadlier and more contagious than the season flu, that's a proven fact and is basically unanimously agreed upon the scientific community. What is argued is just by how much, but those estimates really don't vary too much. All this can easily be found on Google, again with multiple sources to back it up.

You can pick a side (we are all going to die vs. this is overblown) and read the news from your chosen perspective, I would instead chose to do your own unbiased research across multiple sources looking for fact driven stats.

There is a lot of noise right now....

I would avoid relying on the news headlines at this point. They are written to grab your attention and generate views....

They think they're different. No need to worry unless we see people getting sick. By then of course, too many people are sick to prevent mass casualties.

There is for sure either a testing or reporting lag on the weekends, almost every weekend has been lower and then higher the following Monday. Also in NC there was a prison that had a large number of reported cases over the weekend.

i know this is the end of the daily thread almost but whats up with current numbers? the site i check every day (infection2020 i believe) shows that new cases and deaths are down to single digit percent increases. i can understand lack of testing so the new cases might be lower,, but deaths should still be high no?

Those people are still in the minority though. Overall people are interacting with far fewer people than they were prior to the lockdown, so we definitely should see some results even if it’s not perfect.

Reporting is often correlated to the day; for my state Sundays are usually lower but Monday's report is higher. Look at a 3-5 day difference to see if there is a trend or if it's just a blip in info. Also for comparing deaths to infections you have to look at the numbers 10-14 days back as those are usually when the death is symptomatic/diagnosed

People testing positive again seems to match experiences of people experiencing it for 2+ months straight on r/covid19positive. Could researchers figure out what's causing this? And if it's a universal feature AND we cannot stop it, doesn't that mean it's the end?

With the Covid-19 induced shelter in place, driving to work has been an absolute pleasure these past several weeks. In the absence of traffic, I’ve been able to take my sports car to work instead of my commuter car. Sometimes the smallest of things can brighten your day! With that being said, I’m also looking forward to needing my commuter car again...

One thing I hope comes out of this is that people start staying the f*** at home if they are sick at all.

I get that some people don’t really have a choice, and that’s a separate issue, and one I hope we can also change. But people who don’t have to physically be in an office or wherever and come in anyway... I hope they get absolutely ostracized going forward.

the reality is that most people don't get or can't afford sick days. this is the result of milking the working class and cutting benefits to the breaking point. when a majority of americans are living paycheck to paycheck with no savings they can't afford not to work.

Is there anywhere to see state-by-state charts of daily cases and deaths? Now that NYC appears, thankfully, to be flattening out, I'd like to be able to see similar graphs for other states. On worldometers you can see tables, and of course you could manually compile those into a graph, but I imagine that someone is already making state-by-state graphs. Any link?

The IHME model predicts Sweden will have 18,322 deaths by August 4th, despite serious social distancing, reduced public transit use, and lots of working-from-home and isolation of seniors. Is this just because they don't have a formal "lockdown" in place? If Sweden did a half-arsed lockdown like New York or Georgia -- where people still gather at churches and in parks anyway -- would they have much lower number? This is absurd, people. This IHME model had the UK with 60,000+ deaths just a couple days ago -- now it's at 23,000. Just nuts. Meanwhile, a great recession -- maybe a depression -- and cancer patients who can't get the care they need; women locked in homes with abusive partners.

Nobody knows the efficacy breakdown of different individual components of interventions, nor how they interact. So IHME models binary yes or no for the specific whole set they believe effective. If Sweden omits one, their results are not predictable even to the limited extent others are.

Not gonna argue you on the IHME model, but cancer patients would be getting worse care if we were not talking the steps we are right now. The hospitals would just have more Covid19 patients. The only way we could prevent the virus from bringing us into a depression/recession was if we had testing and a plan available before it hit in February....we didn't. A deadly virus spreading through a country is always going to hurt an economy.

this assumes that lockdowns are necessary to mitigate the virus. alternatively, we could be doing stuff like properly managing nursing homes -- aggressive testing of staff and cleaning of facilities -- and keeping mild/moderate COVID19 cases (whether positive test or no-test symptomatic) outside of hospitals.

A deadly virus spreading through a country is always going to hurt an economy.

yes, but it's possible the "lockdown" strategy -- while more comforting to the middle-class/rich who can enjoy the "optics" of health security as they are serviced by "essential" workers -- is responsible for hurting the economy, while an alternative approach (let's say the Swedish or Japanese model) could equally as well mitigate COVID but not do as much economic damage

Here are my thoughts.

There are no mild covid cases in hospitals. Those people are sent home to deal with symptoms. Everyone in a hospital for Covid19 needs to be there.....anyone telling you otherwise is wrong.

Japan would be in full lockdown if their outbreak looked anything like ours. And even now they are worried about a rise of cases in Tokyo. Moreover, their are many cultural differences between the two countries... it really isn't a fair comparison. You can't expect Americans to practice the same restraint and personal hygiene that the Japanese use....they have been doing it for centuries!

Sweden is an interesting case, but early on they have more than double the deaths of their Scandinavian neighbors. There is also a lot of dissention in the ranks.... let's see if it works or backfires. I'm actually hoping it works because at some point we will need to do something similar.

America was woefully unprepared. A lockdown is a last ditch effort to slow the spread and protect our healthcare system. At the earliest feasable time ....we need to start moving away from it because the economic turmoil is really scary as well. But a pandemic is going to take a toll on an economy no matter what. ( Even Sweden is having skyrocketing unemployment.) The only real hope we have is to stop it from ever becoming a pandemic.

I hope that when this is over people realize the value of "essential workers" and we start paying everyone a living wage! I'm with you on that!

i’d say the IHME projection is worthless. it had the UK at 66,000 deaths then it was revised down to 37,000 and now it’s at 23,000. and i remember them saying a fee days ago sweden would see 8,000 deaths now it’s 18,000? but tbh i can’t blame them information is always changing that projections are hard to do and no one knows how the virus will play out in the future. the best they can do is base it on current trends but then by next week the trend will change again and that projection is then worthless.

but i will say the lockdown arguably helps cancer patients the whole point is to prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed that they have no capacity left to treat non covid19 patients. the main problem with covid19 is that if we don’t do anything we’ll not just cause more covid19 deaths but also more deaths from say cancer etc. and a pandemic is always going to hurt the economy even without a lockdown as more people get sick and have to stay at home and people get afraid that they don’t go out as much etc.

i can't blame them either, but the general public (journalists included!) looks at the projections -- they have a very "sexy" Web site -- and reads the projections as being "gospel and verse" rather than an educated guess.

yes, the projections are useful, but journalists need to explain to the public how they are useful, and the limits of the models

oh yh i know. but Journalists do it for 2 reasons one some of them have a political agenda so they see it as a way to bash the left wing or right wing. i mean if a projection shows a horrible outcome then they can easily use it to bash the other side especially if they don’t like the government and vice versa. like the guardian news was heavily promoting that 66,000 projected deaths for the Uk but then again they also don’t like the Uk government so it suits their political views. and also to get clicks. i mean a headline like “study shows so many deaths will happen” is more exciting than a headline simply saying how it’s only an educated guess at current trends.

Can anyone provide a link/source for the age of death for the USA? I'm curious what those numbers look like. I mean, if this is primarily killing old people, then why not lift this shitty SIP and send a caution to all older people to SIP and let the country move the f*** on... This is insane... I'm hearing reports from multiple people that hospitals are like empty around the country... WTF...

The average life expectancy in the US is 78.

In italy the average life expectancy is 82, and the average age of death from coronavirus was around 81.

I also hope we end this (sensibly) and get on with things.

Here's some NYC data:



https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary-deaths-04122020-2.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3xTeGjuCdQ3WhjyYRQRVQdcmmS76NlVdMWDecFBl3BOkrXon1zWr2SnX8



26 total deaths within the 18 - 44 age group, non existing conditions...

now you sit there and tell me we should still be in quarantine, for you know... 12 - 18 months, that's what the governor of NY said this morning...

Is that sound logic to you?

This is my wife Collette, she is a sister at the Royal Bolton Hospital, this weekend we recorded this song with her own lyrics and posted on facebook, it has had over 20k views & 1.5k shares so far and we cant believe the response we are getting from it, my wife is quite shy and it took some pursuading to let me post it, but i believe she deserves to be seen for what she is doing for the NHS and i would love to make her go viral in all this. this is for all our key workers keeping the country going. https://www.facebook.com/james.moreland.75/videos/2804865549603767/

UK has reported way more cases and deaths than China despite having a population 1/20 of China

UK - 88,621 cases / 11,329 deaths

China - 82,160 cases / 3,341 deaths

No wonder WHO official Bruce Aylward said he rather be treated in China

What this tells me is..have at least two to fours weeks worth of food and essential items at all time stocked, be prepared for possible lockdowns at anytime, having savings ( which we we should do all the time anyway) and if you are in the restaurant, bar or entertainment business or a supplier of that type of business, you may be in trouble....at least until we get therapeutics or a vaccine.

I've been sick for five days with a relatively mild variety of symptoms. I have the opportunity to get a Covid test tomorrow at a drive-through facility, but I am concerned about the additional risk of exposing myself to Covid there if I don't already have it. Thoughts?

Those who are conducting the testing are in full PPE, and they're dealing with 100s of other sick people. You going in for a test wont make a difference in their risk.

I'm aware the workers are in full PPE. I'm concerned about incremental risk to me. Of contracting covid if I don't already have it. Presumably they don't change gloves between each car, right?

I'll quote the author's summary

It is difficult to conceive that smoking, a known and major risk factor for bacterial and viral infections (e.g. Arcavi & Benowitz: Cigarette smoking and infection. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164: 2206-16) and which negatively affects the respiratory tract can be protective against a viral infection targeting mainly the same tissues. Moreover, smoking behavior is characterized by repetitive hand-to-mouth movements, a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection which are strongly advised against to reduce viral contamination.

Also it points out many problems with the study.

When will we start seeing the numbers reflect suspected cases/deaths rather than tested cases/deaths, especially in the US? Are any estimates likely to be suppressed by hospitals or governing organisations because of political or liability concerns?

Most countries have been suffering this problem of lack of testing. I'm in the UK and can only see us testing the suspected cases or recovered cases in months rather than weeks.

Might take a year for us to really know what has happened.

No one is suppressing numbers because of political/liability concerns.

You would have to have every doctor and medical examiner in the U.S. on board. The counting of deaths and their causes are taken pretty seriously.

I have no hope for the future anymore. Immunity going away means a vaccine won’t work. Society can’t be shut down forever. Millions are just going to die every year. I have no distractions anymore. I won’t be able to pass online classes and the job market will be shit if I even graduate. The entire world will return to pre-industrial revolution conditions.

Go read headlines during the Swine Flu pandemic. They thought the world was falling in the midst of it as well. We will survive as a country and things will improve over time.

If you haven’t, you should at least read the history section on Wikipedia of the swine flu in 2009. Now pretend these numbers applied to this pandemic. It always seems worse in the moment. You can have hope for the future!

I recently acquired large volumes of the KN-95 mask and am looking for clients to sell to. Where would I go to find clients willing to buy large quantities of masks? I'm not really looking to markup 600% but just trying to get rid of this inventory. Where would I go to sell this? How can I reach out to potential clients?

Question: what do you folks here think about this Dr. Shiva guy? Quite frankly, to me, it sounds like he’s just milking an opportunity to make himself heard to gain some publicity from sheep. if you watch the video, he seems to cherry-pick evidence to then compile together to make an argument based in hypothesis. https://youtu.be/7D1g2QJs1b4

okay. that’s a good point. but i’d also assume that the people here, you and me alike, can spot this stuff and quite frankly, someone who would believe this stuff wouldn’t be on here anyways. plus this thread is about “unconfirmed reports” and “theories” and i’m pretty sure this falls into that. and plus, i was reaching out to see if anyone’s even heard of this guy, and what his credibility is/ what incentive he has for this. it is also worth bringing attention to the fact that people and followings like this even exist. but yes, i do get your point and you are correct.

What about Plague?

Rats are dying off in our cities now - as has happened prior to most plague epidemics, leading their fleas - which may carry plague - to feed upon humans. (https://nypost.com/2020/04/13/starving-rats-resort-to-war-cannibalism-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown/)

The New York City subway is now packed with homeless and is like one giant petri dish at the moment. The #2 Train is now the homeless express.

What are the chances of plague developing in our urban areas?

That's fascinating.

Still, nothing from the Daily Mail is "very important."

People who are experts in this field have confirmed that the virus was not engineered in a lab. I understand that for a lot of people this is just too much of a coincidence, but it doesn't make it true. Facts matter.

Anybody hear about Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai? I just watched this video. He criticizes Dr. Fauci and social distancing. He has all these degrees and a PhD. He makes good points such as that we get deprived of vitamin D, an important nutrient for our immune system, by staying indoors.

But to say that basically the immunocompromised or elderly should be the ones to stay in? Going outside would be an even scarier world for them. That ventilators are killing those with pneumonia, and those should be corrected with high doses of Vit C instead? I don't understand where he's getting these ideas. Am I missing something here?

Hasn't been any deaths in my county for many days in a row now. Hospital censuses are low across the city so low they are sending people home because they arn't needed. Our state deaths are also very low. How long is this hysteria going to be allowed to continue before we call people out on it?

It's almost like actions taken to slow the spread worked. Maybe it was premature for your particular county but when you are flying blind it makes sense to err on the side of caution and relax if/when you have evidence saying otherwise. The alternative was to do nothing and cross fingers.
