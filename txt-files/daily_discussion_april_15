Nah those people have shifted to: "it's worth sacrificing lives to save the economy"

Ah yes, valuing a social, imaginary construct over real, physical life.

We do it here in the US every flu season. If we instituted nation-wide heavy lockdown during flu season we could probably save tens of thousands of lives. But it's not worth it.

We don't shut down because the flu can't overwhelm hospitals, unlike this virus. Also, there is a vaccine for the flu that is available everywhere in America.

Agreed. You’re fully aware though that the flu vaccine isn’t 100% effective. Some years it’s less than 50%. We could undoubtedly save thousands of lives each year with extreme social distancing. We all as a society feel that saving these lives isn’t worth shutting down our way of life.

Well playing devil's advocate here where does physical or human life begin? Could it be that the value of life is also a construction based on self preservation?

Just defending the fact that if a system benefits and works and has an impact on actual physical life, then it should be valued more. Hence why it is also important to keep the economy in mind because if the world goes into a recession, millions more will die as collateral damage instead of COVID deaths.

I do agree though the safety and containment of the virus is much more important. Sweden's getting wrecked

Medical professionals around the world are seeing evidence suggesting COVID-19 could be causing a slew of issues unrelated to the lungs, including heart inflammation, acute kidney disease, neurological malfunction, blood clots, intestinal damage and liver problems, The Washington Post reported. Nearly half of those hospitalized with the virus have blood or protein in their urine, showing early damage to their kidneys, according to Alan Kliger, a nephrologist at the Yale School of Medicine.

Does anyone knows if the travel ban for flights coming from Europe is still active? I am trying to bring my mother (she is not a US citizen) over here from a country that is not on the banned country list (Romania) but she would have a layover in one of those countries (Netherlands or France). Technically the ban expired on Apr 13th but i can't find anything official.

Is the type of people participating in this reddit making the managing of this pandemic in the US seem more political than it really is? I keep seeing posts about pressure and lobbying to reopen soon regardless of the opinions of medical health experts.

In contrast, here in Canada there is effectively unanimous support for continuing to follow public health authority guidelines. Here's a snippet from a Globe and Mail article (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-business-urges-steady-cautious-approach-to-restarting-canadian/)

Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the premiers and territorial leaders before their weekly meeting Thursday evening, urging them to listen to health authorities before restarting the economy.

“Governments should not feel pressured to move faster than public health considerations permit. A slow, steady and carefully calibrated approach to restarting the economy is the best possible way to maintain public confidence and avoid future lockdowns,” Mr. Hyder wrote. “Decisions should be based on sound medical analysis, accompanied by widespread, systematic testing and contact tracing of positive cases.”

Back to my question for opinions from those in the US. Is there really the huge lack of consensus in the states on how to handle the economy reopening, or is it just being exaggerated on this reddit because of the type of people who are participating here?

Is there really the huge lack of consensus in the states on how to handle the economy reopening

That's a very complicated question, but yes there is extreme polarization in the US. However polling suggests most people here are hesitant about going out and doing their normal activities before a vaccine is available. Of course, over time that might change.

Here's a very rough guide-

The president and his fans, mega churches, investment bankers, and certain industries want it open and fast

on the other hand -

Health experts (not dr oz) , people who can think beyond 2 +2 =4, people who know a little history (ie the Spanish Flu and what happened when things were prematurely opened up), some large businesses want more testing and more distancing and a saner approach

Serious question. I am currently dealing/living with someone who is using hand sanitizer to santize the outside of grocery packets and even food packaging after purchasing them and bringing them home. My question is whether the virus be transferred via contact with inanimate objects (like grocery packets/food packaging) if someone with the virus has come into contact with said object? A verifiable source on this, if possible, would be appreciated as I'd like to know whether or not the person is being too paranoid or I'm not taking things seriously enough.

They aren’t too paranoid. At least one documented case of someone who had stayed indoors for weeks catching coronavirus from groceries left outside their door.

World wide there are about 6-8k deaths per day but only 100k cases per day. All countries only seem to be testing critical cases as they can't keep up with demand. Is it fair to assume we are getting at least 250-350k cases a day now based on death rate? Or is the death rate closer to 6%? Any better in depth post or info on this?



7,000 / .02 = 350k

7,000 / .03 = 233k

Most countries who did populations studies (where they tested random people, not just symptomatic ones) report that the estimated mortality is probably under 1%. However those countries tend to have better healthcare and population health so their data might be a little skewed.

No the fatality rate is nowhere near 6%

We don't know how many actual infected people there are but we hopefully we will have an idea soon after some surveys have completed.

Just wanted to add, there are a lot of fat people in San Antonio since it appears that obesity is probably a factor in the fatality rate for this virus.

Also, it looks like the obesity rate in a community has an affect on the rate of infection growth, but I don't have many data points on that.

Why are the various trackers reporting under 30,000 deaths in the U.S.? I thought we got to 31k yesterday. I feel like accurate reporting, especially on that metric, is important to keep people from downplaying the risks.

It seems to be they're figuring out how to record the additional deaths from New York that had been previously deemed probable. If they add them all on one day, there will be a huge spike, versus trying to figure out what days each death occured and seeing a smoother curve. The worldometers site has a decent explanation of their process. But I agree, I'd like to see the total deaths updated.

They all start the 'day' at different times, so the counting doesn't sync up with each other.

Just stick to one tracker.

We have built and tested this UVC light box to treat N95 masks for our local Fire dept who is running out of PPE. Tested by our local university with a UVC radiometer. This design can treat 6 masks every 5 minutes. UVC used in this way will not degrade the filtration of the mask.

FYI you are required to follow CDC guidelines for disinfection of N-95's.

The issue with your set up won't be the filter it will be the rubber. The UVC will degrade the rubber for the elastic and it simply will break when you stretch it. If you do it long enough it will actually just crumble up. Some remove the rubber but most disinfect with other ways as its simply more effecient.

Same problem with ozone which also works very well other than the rubber issue

Research shows that the mask and elastic can withstand hundreds of treatments before showing any physical degradation. Our treatment is 1 J/cm2. See paper:

This is the wrong sub to discuss such things. Anything that doesn't sow fear, panic, and trump hatred is unwelcome here.

That said, it's hard to know what to think at this point. The allegations seem very plausible, perhaps moreso than the official Chinese story, but we'll have to wait for proof. If true, the ramifications are a bit frightening.

Maybe because it isn't "now believed." Trump, who believes in all sorts of other conspiracies said they're "looking into it." Proof of nothing.

Also, the virus has been analyzed at a genetic level, and there's no indication at all it was engineered in a lab.

What difference does it make? Either way if it was made on a lab or coming from a wet market where animals are treated like shit it still comes from China and now it's a worldwide problem.

I do think we need to find who's is responsible for this pandemic but I don't think it's something that we should do now.

No, they didn't die of shock.

They are discovered dead, and nurses claim to have not seen symptoms. When in reality, nobody paid attention to them beforehand. Pretending like they had no symptoms and were not noticeably sick is a way of avoiding responsibility.

3 people at my job we're diagnosed, we closed today (Thursday the 16th) and are expected to go back on Monday. Is this acceptable?? I'm sure more people than those 3 have it, we all share a cafeteria and a 3 stall bathroom. I would think we would need to close down for a week to let people check they have no symptoms

I work in HR & we have had 4 confirmed at my site, not shutting down but increasing cleaning efforts & such. We’ve had other sites with more confirmed cases who have shut down for 2 days to deep clean & reopen. It really sucks, but we are considered an essential business & our work cannot be remote so it is what it is...

Not defending Sweden's strategy, just wanted to shed a light on the situation here, since some people are suggesting everything is carrying on as normal and that the government are doing nothing. This place is normally almost packed to capacity at this hour.

Someone copy/pasted a comment from a Swede who went on to explain that while there's no official orders for people to stay at home or social distance, that most in Sweden are doing it anyway. Bars and restaurants may be open, but they're not all that busy, and people are being sat 6 feet away from each other etc.

Point being, Sweden may not have official lockdowns, but they're not doing "nothing." A lot of people here in the US seem to feel that if we lift lockdowns, and cancel social distancing, that somehow things are going to magically be better (like that Easter miracle!), "just like Sweden!!"

Exactly. We're not perfect - there is no doubt that some people aren't taking this seriously enough - but most people are doing their bit.

And you're right, there are not many official orders (except gatherings of 50 people or more, which is strictly forbidden), but there are official recommendations and most people seem to be following them.

How are we ever going to get a fairly accurate death count? There's a lot of undercounted deaths, but then there is also people who have died of other causes, but because they were positive for Covid-19 they get counted as a covid-19 death. Seems like we will never know what the actual death count is.

I need advice if I’m overreacting about my parents visiting during this pandemic.

Long story short, I lived in a highly infected city and my parents had a condo far away that they were supposed to be moving to this spring. Bc of COVID they couldn’t move so they told my boyfriend and I to escape to the condo, self quarantine for 2 weeks and ride out the storm in a safer area. My parents’ current home is 2.5 hrs away.

My mom has a doctors appointment next week for her hip so she wants to come stay at their condo that we’re currently sheltering in place in. and also has mentioned coming by other times. She is also hiring people to come do construction around the condo. Because my parents are high risk, I feel it is not a good idea to 1) be together when we’re supposed to be sheltering in place and 2) hire outside people to come into the home that they’re staying in. I expressed my concern to my mom but she blew me off saying I’m being over dramatic and can’t prevent them from coming to their own condo.

I guess at this point I need to pack up and move somewhere else to rent, or go back to my city. I just want to see if I’m being over dramatic in thinking this might not be a good idea. We have a shelter in place order here currently.

Stopping the spread:

According to the CDC: N95 Respirators Not for Use by the General Public

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that the general public wear N95 respirators to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including coronavirus (COVID-19). Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

But studies and systematic literature reviews support the efficacy of N95s over cloth masks to stop the spread of corona and other viruses. Can't the government get involved to get N95s to the general population? https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2020/04/10/how-to-reduce-risk-from-covid-19/

The supply to meet that demand simply doesn’t exist.

N95’s are disposable, so not only are you trying to make enough for the population, but after every day you have to replace the ones that were disposed yesterday.

This virus is killing people by the amount of viral load they receive and the people taking the absolute brunt of the viral load are healthcare workers, so it’s perfectly fair that those in the most danger on the frontline receive the best protection we can produce.

I'm not suggesting for a second that PPE priority should not be healthcare workers, but if the government is serious about stopping the spread we need more N95s for the public. It's not a question of "fairness", we need to stop the spread. And if you just use one to go in the supermarket with, you can certainly reuse them especially if you rotate them so you can set some aside for a few days.

It sounds all good and well saying that but it’s logistically impossible.

The factories, industry, manpower and raw materials to make N95’s on that scale literally doesn’t exist. It’s physically impossible for supply to meet demand here, and no amount of taking it seriously can get around that, even if the government layed down cold hard cash they’d just get told sorry, we can’t fulfill that order.

In the entire US, at absolutely maximum capacity right now they’re just about scraping 50 million N95s per month. Per month!. If you think at the end of the month they give those 50 million masks to 50 million people? They use them for one day, dispose of them, and suddenly you’ve wasted an entire month for a days worth of protection, whereas that same production could have been used to sustain the healthcare workers until the next batches are ready.

I understand there are rigorous requirements, but compare making more masks to the production efforts in world war II. No comparison. Let's get it done. https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/03/29/making-an-n95-mask-for-covid-19-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know/#2cc9511c4989

Difference being though, gas masks from the war were issued once and were multiple use. Not to mention by this point chemical warfare had been outlawed by the Geneva convention so gas attacks were actually quite rare.

N95s masks get disposed of quicker than they can be made and almost everyone needs a new one on a daily basis.

That quote apparently started from one conspiracy theorist radio host named Mae Brussel who hosted her own show called, Dialogue: Conspiracy.

To say it's widely attributed only means that a bunch of conspiracy theorists believe it, there's zero evidence he actually said anything of the sort.

Some recovered patients still have virus expelled from their bodies in their stool, it is not clear whether this is an infection risk, recommendation is to close the toilet lid and flush twice just to be safe. They are believed to be not infectious from a respiratory perspective, but that might change with future studies.

No. Your immune system creates antibodies that recognize and cause the destruction of the virus. Eventually all of virus is gone but the antibodies remain in order to handle future infections.

There are doomers floating around Reddit that push a “there’s no proof this happens with C19” narrative but they have no evidence to support this claim. If it were true you would not be seeing many recoveries.

US unemployed now at 22 million I believe.

IMF estimates a 3% global GDP drop. The Great Recession of 2008 was 1%, so this is going to be a lot worse.

However, it's still unknown what the recovery will look like, since this depression isn't caused by economic factors which makes for a lot of unknowns. Experts no longer think it will be a V bounce back, but are uncertain exactly how long it will take to recover some industries. I expect tourism is going to be down for a long time. Sports are going to have to figure out how to make money without crowds. Restaurants, hotels, movie theatres will all struggle.

A lot of Asia countries did very hard containment orders to keep it under control, along with lots of testing.

India is still a bit of a puzzle. It's spreading very slowly there, and the contributing factor isn't clear. I could be lack of testing, weather, or others. But it is currently doubling every week, so more needs to be done there as well.

Which area of London do you live in? I think people are quite respectful of the lockdown and mostly are behaving the whey they are requested to. London is a gigantic with people from very different beliefs and backgrounds, I think it's normal that some people won't comply with the rules but I believe the majority actually are.

Must be a common question, I don't know.

Say I have received a package and it has coronavirus on its surface. Or the delivery man was already affected. I shall obviously wash my hands after picking it up. What do I do then? Do I leave it overnight before opening? What should be the safest procedure?

Toss the box, wipe down the contents with disinfectant (or leave in the sun for a few days) then clean up the surface you placed the box on. The virus can still survive on materials, but it has no way to jump off them unless you remove them somehow.

You can leave it for 3 days (max time of virus survival) or expose to temperature of 70 degree for 30 minutes or thoroughly disinfect with special liquid.

You could also wash hands anytime after you touch it for 3 days which is what i do and generally wash hands often during the day especially before meals etc

You can also wear mask at all times to remind yourself not to touch your face. As long as you not touch face you safe from infected surfaces.

You dont need to be that much strict about it because chance is rather low so its not like every contact with surfaces with virus on it results in infection. Dont know percentages tho

If one positive comes from this I hope it's the death of open floorplan offices

Better off hoping for work at home. Open floor plans for low level office workers isn't going away. Office space is to expensive

My father had quadrupled bypass a couple years ago. He has asthma, sleep apnea, diabetes, and serosus just to name a few of his pre existing conditions. In the last couple years hes been on the up n up but cannot afford with his health history to mess around at all I lived with him but moved out so u can take care of him from the outside so he can exist with %100 chance of 0 contact.

I wipe down all his groceries and stage them in his garage for 5 days before he goes out to get them.

But now I have a problem. I've run out of all the disinfect we had sense before the virus and hes running low on distilled water for his medical machine. The grocery stores here are doing the first hour open to the elderly and these people buy absolutely everything, every. Single. Day. Nothing is ever left.

Idk what to do.

A soapy water mixture is an effective disinfectant if left passively on a surface for at least 5 min. Diluted bleach also works. For research recommended disinfectabts, https://covidpapers.github.io/posts/stability-of-sars-cov-2-in-different-environmental-conditions/#.XooRVhkGU04.reddit Or https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html

Pharmacies also have distilled water, most of virus will be gone after 5 days. Use disefectant that you have to water todillute, it will last longer. You can only do what your best, and ot sounds like you've done well. Every day treatments improve.

i went to my local ACE hdw and they had gal containers of 100% isopropal alcohol

shouldn't be hard to get Iso A . huget refineries are not making gas much anymore. distribution issue. try auto supply store. push comes to shove use things like

bleach too works. try non traditional outlet like builders suppliers, auto supply, paint stores.



I found the time after elder hours just the same, traffic wise, maybe less. seniors are already awake a 7AM so there is no problem for them to swarm .

do you guys think we will ever go to work "normal", if we work in a big space office, which multiple people sitting next to each other, without mask?

When will we all be able to meet friends again, and if, only in public? having dinner impossible? what do you guys think?

Eventually, yes to all of it. Big offices will have to change in the short term, but long term they’ll be possible, but many places may just ditch that model.

As for friends, it’ll be possible again. Things suck right now, but one day we will be back to normal

Expect a newly established ‘normal’ in several months (3-4), with varying restrictions based on whatever insights and developments (treatment, medicine). Get used to that for the coming 1 to 2 years, maybe more.

As to the specific office context you mentioned. Especially in the coming months this will require social distancing adjustments.

Meeting friends I think would be limited by group size.

My office just yesterday was talking about how certain roles may never return, they’ll stay fully remote. This crisis has shown that some roles are as effective as before and really don’t need the office space except for the occasional meeting that they could come use a shared room to host instead of their own office. It will also save a ton of money currently being spent to rent office space.

hm, hehe, so thats a whole new discussion then. Interesting way to see it like that, really "out of the box" he ;)
I guess you should never underestimate the "sociologic" part of it. As we are all humans, we like to engage, meet, connect, not only virtually. I guess having huge people work from home all the time, could be a risk, potentially, for mental health. Thats just how I see it, but yeah, really interesting angle you have there.

I think we will reach a stage by August September whereby the government will have made adequate provisions/precautions to fight the virus and allow the individual to determine what they want to do considering the underlying risk of picking up the virus.

There will be a degree of autonomy given as they cannot enforce a lockdown long term but will hopefully be in a position to deal with a second wave and thusly allow more interaction amongst the populace

there should be alot of info on how the virus spreads in next months.

for instance there is some talk that kids don't transmit, so schools could open.

remember what is shut down is nearly all business, including ones that have little customer interaction. they could easily open if they had customers.

data, empirical evidences, data, science. depend on it.

something 1/2 of our great nation has been trained to distrust.

remember the Space Shuttle mission was a faith based initiative and prayer won WW2.

what do you mean by adequate provisions/precautions?

the virus can spread airborn, by speaking, we have to assume this. So how would you prevent an exponential spread and overload of the health care system in August/September? By which measures? Without any medications or even a vaccine?

Of course, we will then know the virus and the forms of transmission a lot better, ramped up our testing and maybe health care ressources, but still, If somebody would go to work, highly infectious, and talk to 30 people, he could infect 30 people on one day? I only see being allowed to go in the office in shifts of lets say 5 people, or wearing masks all the time? thats why I'm asking, if you guys could assume or think of some potential measures.

And you talk about a degree of autonomy: exactly this is really critized, especially here in germany, austria, where we want to save lives and protect the elderly + risk groups. So to say: it's in your own responsibility, is exactly the approach we must not go.

If social distancing measures stay in place the virus will shrink to smaller and smaller geographic areas, disappearing in many areas. Authorities will be able to manage outbreaks on a local level through isolation and contact tracing allowing the vast majority to go on about their lives.

Dude, this virus came from just one guy eating a bat in China. So long as a single person on Earth has the virus and either doesn't know or doesn't care, it will spread again if things "go back to normal".

What percentage of the human population do you think are irresponsible idiots? Multiply that % by 7 billion them multiply that number by the infection rate.

That's still thousands, if not millions, that will continue to spread the virus until there is a vaccine.

Autonomy will get people you love killed. Can some businesses that don't require human interaction or very little reopen? Sure. Will there be any way to stop the coming recession or depression? Not without a vaccine.

Makes sense. I couldn't get my head around how my grandmother who is 80 with diabetes got diagnosed with COVID 19, 2 and a half weeks ago, seems to have thankfully beaten the virus without needing a ventilator or I.C but on the other hand, seeing many young healthy doctors and nurses in the news dying from it. Very sad.

it was IMHE that said without social distancing there would be 1-2 M death. IMHE is the same organization providing the current model of 67,000 with stringent social distancing.

so you can assume that to rescend SD, the trend will beback towards 1M. it seems to me anything above 60k reported would mean we choose to let people die for the sake of commerce. the problem is that the people who die will not likely have any say in the matter. someone will go to work and infect a stranger and the stranger will have not say in the matter of his death. We don't know if opening biz will result in one job being created. I, for one, will social distance for the rest of my life because i am at risk. There are 50M or more of us 'at risk'. every overweight diabetic is 'at risk'.

BTW we are halfway there, before the peaks of 45 states and ignoring unreported deaths due to CV. i think there are alot of deaths not attributed to CV.

1-2 million deaths. And hospitals turning into complete no-go zones, totally flooded with covid-19 cases. And there's been a steady stream of stories of rural hospitals going out of business, shutting down.

There are some mathematical models and those are extremely disheartening but the outcome strongly depends on many individual factors like the health care system (like Germany has one of the worlds best systems and is not only considered the second best country in handling this crisis but also has far lower death rates than for example the USA), the workers laws (a country where ill people can stay home and isolate as well as get tested has different spreading numbers as one where those things are not possible without ruining yourself), the flexibility of workplaces and administrative things (can you provide much home office workplaces and solving things with phone calls and mails or does the whole economy and administration work on a system that requires physically meeting people?), the access to masks and willingness of people to wear them, the willingness of people to keep the nessecary distances, the hygienic regulations, if it's a tightly packed region or if people can easily keep the safe distances from each other, the accessible forms of transportation, the country's abilities to test people, the options to provide for self quarantine people and many more factors.

Well, we know how the United States healthcare system ranks among other countries in the world.

We've seen some of the attitudes towards wearing masks and social distancing in the United States, recent example in Michigan. Hashtags like #ReopenAmerica on social media.

Metro areas have been forced to face the reality and come up with their own solutions in a lot of cases. The rural areas on the other hand haven't faced the full force of this thing. Rural areas will get bright red clumps of outbreaks here and there, but it'll be more of a rolling epidemic out there...and if you opine further about ideology differences between urban and rural - that's a considerable set of variables too.

Social distancing is pointless with these new rules that grocery stores and other essential businesses are implementing. My grocery store has changed their layout. Now it funnels everyone through a path and guarantees that almost every person will touch two or three of the same surfaces. I went to a taco place for takeout. All of the takeout orders are all piled on one table with no labeling except for a receipt inside the bag. I watched every single person who entered the place touch the inside of every bag. There was no real training or explanation of what social distancing should be, so now businesses are making their own rules that may actually be exacerbating the problem. I’m even guilty. I wore gloves to pump gas, but then I touched the car door handle with my gloves and later touched it again without gloves. Without massive training in effective protocols, all of these mitigation efforts are just magical thinking. I watched every single person unknowingly touch their face. Without a massive countrywide testing program in place, we’re all just f***ing around on the deck of the Titanic at this point.

If you're wondering why new daily confirmed cases have stalled around 26K - 30K the last 2 weeks:

the number of samples commercial labs handle each day fell from 108,000 on April 5 to 75,000 by April 12

I may start doing them less frequently than daily. It's a bit of a grind and I think people start to ignore things if they're posted too often.

All I'm doing is taking the data from https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily and adding three columns: New Cases, Est Cases, and DPP. That site updates every day and the extra columns are easy to calculate (my posts include the formulas).

I appreciate that you're interested in the data. The complacency that's being bred by fixating on the number of new daily cases while ignoring the bigger picture is dangerous. We need more testing to know what we're dealing with and to make the life or death decisions that certain people want to rush into.

This morning I was curious about why certain parts of the Johns Hopkins map never lit up. Take a look at this: United States COVID-19 Cases and Population Density by County - Apr. 15, 2020

And thank you for that Politico article. People regularly ask me if the stagnant number of new tests is because demand has plateaued. Last night I heard on the news that in New Jersey you have to have a doctor's note to get tested (unless you're a nurse or first responder). I immediately questioned how people who just lost their jobs and insurance are able to afford to go to the doctor to get a note.

I kind of wish they would've called this "SARS2" rather than "Coronavirus" right from the beginning. People would've paid much more attention. This is basically a less dangerous, more infectious SARS.

That article certainly is eerie. I wonder if more research will be given to this types of coronaviruses now because it is still only a matter of time before another one emerges. It could be even worse than our current pandemic. Imagine how our society would handle it if an airborne coronavirus disease with a 30% CFR emerged. Shudder.

It's a nightmare scenario: An infectious disease is spreading around the world and threatening to topple civilization as we know it. But what kind of disease could do this?

"We need to get serious about respiratory viruses," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, who led the report. "[There's] a lot of focus on diseases that aren't going to be able to change civilization in a way that something that's spread through the respiratory route would be."

Man, just reading this broke me, so I can’t imagine what you’re feeling. I created an account just so I could give you a reply.

This too, shall pass.

I know that’s a cliche, and it doesn’t help   at the moment. But it’s true. I can feel it in my bones. Your mom will be ok, and you will figure this out. I’m hoping that someone here in this thread will be able to help you out a bit more than just some words. I’m on my last 20 dollars for the month of April and I’m reading that I might not even get the stimulus check because I have so much debt. WHY THE f*** WOULD YOU GIVE PEOPLE EMERGENCY FUNDS THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY INTERCEPTED BY THESE RAT f*** CREDIT CARD COMPANIES????!!! Oh wait. I know exactly who would allow that to happen. Smfh.

The point is, you’re gonna be ok. You wrote out that whole post and I bet when you started it you thought that nobody would read it for a while. But here we are like 8 minutes later and I’m here dude. PM if you need someone to vent to my dude. One word of caution: my account keeps getting banned (got in a fight on enough sanders spam and they made sure I was banned from the whole site. So now I have to make a new account every day if I want to upvote or comment on something). Soo if you do want to chat just hang tight I’ll reply with a similar username as this one ASAP.

I am sincerely hopeful that you and your mom will be ok my man. And I hope this gets enough eyes on it that someone can help ya out a bit. We all could use it man, I know I could. I’m f***ing terrified.

I'm literally breaking. I've spent the last six years taking care of my mom with cancer after my dad was killed in 2012. I put myself in 60k debt to do everything I could for her and to help her, while putting myself through school for Accounting so I could have a safe life and give her the help she needed. I fell into a massive, massive depression due to feeling hopeless at the time / my ex fiancee of five years breaking up with me due to how difficult my life situations were, which led to my GPA going from a 4.0 to a 3.1 at graduation and wasn't able to land any of the jobs I needed at the time. I had two jobs lined up, and both were cancelled due to Covid. We just lost our home due to our landlord dying and a complicated situation that arose from that which had my mom refusing to stay due to feeling like she would lose her best friend if we enforced squatter rights (never rent from friends of family...). Her mind isn't all there from her cancer treatments, which were botched and fused her organs together.... And from strokes.... And she isn't taking much of this nearly as seriously as she needs to be, and it usually ends up in an argument when I try to get her to stay home and safe. I'm 29 and she's 58. I have no family, and am going to lose my mom in the upcoming months. She's a heavy smoker, overweight, probably still has cancer (she stopped going to her checkups after it was "cured"), suffered from strokes, has extremely high blood pressure and bottoms out / passes out from it once every couple months. She's going to die, I'm going to be homeless with 60k debt that was now a complete waste due her dying (15k from schooling, 35k from helping her), and I don't know what to do. I have a border collie who is the only reason I won't kill myself, and can't even take care of him at this point. Can't get a place due to not working, can't work due to Covid unless I go work at a grocery store or something, which is high risk and will basically have me get it for sure and indirectly kill my mom. I don't know what to do. Akron Ohio.

Hello, I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. I can't give you a direct fix to all of this, I wish I could, but I can say that you are trying your best and that is all anyone can do. This might sound odd, but have you tried religious organizations that give free housing? It sounds to me like you have several challenges ahead of you, first dealing with the emotional part of this is crucial if you want to take control of the situation, do you have anyone you can talk to?

Unfortunately I do not have any answers that can fix your problem (wish I could!). You are not alone: many of us are in similar weird & twisted circumstances at the moment. Try a meeting where you will be in a community of people, some farther along in their process than you (and some not). You can listen to their experiences, share your own, and get some strength and hope. Here are many online meetings: https://coda.org/find-a-meeting/online-meetings/ Just FYI too---you are NOT broken. You are human. We all have our "shit" to deal with, at different times. This Too Shall Pass eventually. Wishing you the best and praying for your well being.

Does anyone know if food banks want money donations or food donations right now? I just got my stim check, but I was also fortunate enough to start a higher paying job 2 weeks ago and I think that others need it more than I do. I know food banks are struggling with all the supply line issues that this has caused, and while they normally want cash, I am wondering if this crisis has changed that.

It is always better to donate money to food banks than food. The food banks have purchasing power and get the best possible price from the manufacturers and distributors. They will get way more food for your money than you will. It's an awesome thought but don't buy food just to donate it, send the food bank the money directly.

Thanks for thinking of the food banks

When we started social distancing, I thought the consensus was that the goal is to flatten the curve, so that hospitals don't get overwhelmed. Now, everyone seems to be acting like the purpose is to just avoid people ever getting the illness. What is up with that? It is contagious enough that it seems wildly unlikely that we will be able to actually prevent it spreading to over half the population before a vaccine is available. That is what the most well-researched reporting was saying when we started social distancing. I am NOT saying we should relax social distancing. What I'm saying is, the point of it is to slow down the spread. Not to stop it entirely until we have a widely available vaccine.



Also, what is with all the continued focus on case counts, especially globally? Even the case counts in most Western countries are almost irrelevant, because testing has mostly been limited to people who are really really sick, and not even all of them. But in most of the developing world, tests are most definitely MUCH less widely available, and their case counts are just meaningless. Why do we pretend otherwise?



Third thing; the idea of hitting "the peak". If social distancing is relaxed before a vaccine is developed (and I mean, it has to be relaxed before that, right? We can't do this for 18 months...), then cases are just going to rise and peak again, right? I get that a bell curve would be what we'd get if the disease was allowed to just run rampant, but the neat and tidy "flattened" bell curve that we've all seen on charts, assumes that we continue a consistent level of social distancing measures until a vaccine is created and widely administered, or so many people have gotten the illness that it ceases to spread as quickly (herd immunity).

I think it's because we are getting more worrisome data coming out regarding what this actually does. At this point, I've seen enough red flags about long term effects, that there is no way I want to get this until we know more.

It's natural that people are afraid of getting it. It just seems like people are living in a bit of a fantasy world where social distancing will actually prevent the majority of the population from getting it within the next 12-18 months.

Hey guys, got some great news! My father, who tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in the month, has officially recovered! All me and my siblings, and my mom as well have tested negative. My father got super lucky because he has underlying conditions that could’ve made things much worse but fortunately it was pretty mild symptoms. Now we just wait until it’s safe to live life again I guess.

The new coronavirus kills by inflaming and clogging the tiny air sacs in the lungs, choking off the body’s oxygen supply until it shuts down the organs essential for life.

But clinicians around the world are seeing evidence that suggests the virus also may be causing heart inflammation, acute kidney disease, neurological malfunction, blood clots, intestinal damage and liver problems. That development has complicated treatment for the most severe cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and makes the course of recovery less certain, they said.

The prevalence of these effects is too great to attribute them solely to the “cytokine storm,” a powerful immune-system response that attacks the body, causing severe damage, doctors and researchers said.

Almost half the people hospitalized because of covid-19 have blood or protein in their urine, indicating early damage to their kidneys, said Alan Kliger, a Yale University School of Medicine nephrologist who co-chairs a task force assisting dialysis patients who have covid-19.

For me it is not so much "thank you" it is more pure outrage that a lot of other people are exhibiting behaviors that already take your hard job (I don't miss my days of retail and dealing with customers when you don't have product) and make it harder. Outrage that at the start of this many stores were not implementing policies not only for customer safety, but your safety as well. That is starting to change, around my area at least (Plastic protectors at the registers, allowing employees to wear masks). So, thank you for dealing with all this extra bs that you would not have normally had to deal with.

I really wish more people could recognize that multiple things could be true.

Trump horribly screwed up his response to the coronavirus, both before it began (firing the pandemic preparation team in 2018), while it developed (doing little to nothing in February), and currently (most of what he's doing right now). There is absolutely zero reason for anyone to defend his response to the virus. Zero.

The Chinese government played a key role for the virus becoming as devastating as it has, from covering it up when it began to affect Wuhan (possibly causing it to become much more severe than it could've been), to misinforming the WHO at times. Combined with some of the actions occurring currently, they deserve a significant amount of blame as well for it becoming as globally devastating as it has.

Both things are true. It isn't one or the other. Trump and China both deserve ample blame, and (in a fair world, which sadly does not exist), both should be punished for their incompetence.

Stop saying emergency room doctors nurses etc are on the front lines. I'm married to one and it should not be this way. They should be the last line of defense. Front lines are the entire public who need to freaking do their part to make sure there are less patients to begin with.

I couldn't start a new job due to the pandemic. They had just more-or-less completed the hiring process, and then told me we'll have to reconnect after all of this is over. I'm a full-time student (non-traditional, 25 y/o) and wasn't working for some time before that - but I was completely broke and this job was my saving grace. Now I can't apply for unemployment insurance because I technically wasn't working yet. I've been applying nonstop to any remote positions I can find with no luck. I don't know what to do and how I'll manage my finances - does anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance!

Happy Wednesday everyone! If you are able, please consider supporting the food bank and other like organizations. They are in desperate need as demand has increased while donations have decreased. You can donate to the organization OR your local food bank. They accept food and monetary donations however it is better to give them a monetary donation so that they have the ability to purchase what they need at likely a better price. Donate at: https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank

Coronavirus has resulted in an unprecedented need for food that the food banks are ill prepared for. In the meantime, food costs are increasing while food donations are decreasing. This pandemic is a tragedy but let us triumph in the darkness. More detailed info on the need can be found here: https://lettersontextualspaghettification.com/2020/04/13/foodbankaid/

I noticed that as well. People seem to not realize it's one of the stages of grief. Strangely enough I don't think I've hit the anger stage, I'm less angry and more bummed out about my loss of normalcy.

There's also an annoying and vocal contingent of conservatives who are already complaining about the lockdowns and reverting back to the "it's just a flu bro" argument. They think these lockdowns are unnecessary if we're "only" going to have 20k deaths.

I find THOSE folks starting to become rather irritating to deal with. They don't know how pandemics work.

Although many of you probably are, I urge everyone to stop shopping at large supermarket chains and instead to buy as much as possible from local ethnic stores/bodegas/etc. They need the business much more, usually have fresh produce/dairy/eggs/toiletries, and whoknows! you might come across a food item you've never seen before & love it.

Life is shit right now, but a little bit of good food, good music, & good conversation can really make the teensiest difference. The only way out is through y'all! Stay safe, stay sane(ish), & stay the f*** home <3

I'm starting to wonder if my family had it around the first week of March. My wife had a cough with chest pain but no fever. My one year old son had a high fever and cough but tested negative for the flu our pedestrian suspected it was a false negative. All at the same time I started feeling really really weird like my head and chest were full. I was having chest pain and light headedness. I had no fever no cough but weird headaches and a general mental cloudiness.

My wife convinced me to go to the emergency room. I'm African American and my blood pressure has never been great but it's never been over 145. Well in the emergency room it was like 170/110. They tested me to see if I was having or had a heart attack and wasn't and didn't. They ran some additional tests. Lectured me about my eating habits without asking what my typical diet is and discharged me.

A few days later I saw my primary care physician and my blood pressure was still pretty high and she put me on lisinopril. Then I started feeling worse for a while my blood pressure at one point was in the low 180s/110s. Then it stopped one day and that was it. I've been feeling fine ever since. My blood pressure is actually in the green now that I'm on meds.

It wasn't until Monday when I read reports of much higher rates of heart attacks in NYC that I put two and two together. I had forgotten that my one year old had a fever then or that my wife had that weird cough she couldn't shake. The day I went to the ER was also they day my region announced their first case. Last but not least I looked up my blood work from the hospital and it showed signs I was fighting an infection.

I suspect we had it but we aren't changing our social distancing ways until we can get a serum test to know for sure.

Please, I sincerely beg you, don’t attack or discriminate against Asian Americans. This is 100% fault of CCP. NOT fault of Chinese-Vietnamese-, Taiwanese-, Korean-, Burmese-, Laotian-, Japanese-, Thai-Americans, and ones that I didn’t mention.

I am saying this as a Chinese American. I was recently verbally abused in a grocery store. My relatives in San Francisco were robbed and attacked in their own house. Yet, we have done absolutely nothing wrong. We are Americans just like anyone else. We are frustrated and affected as well. We want America to return back to normal equally desperate.

In Colombia, a conventional ventilator can cost up to USD 27,000, however, a team of local researchers based in Medellin have recently developed a USD 2,000 prototype to help ICUs cope with the coronavirus epidemic.

Medical licensing institute Invima officially aproved this week the production and use of the new ventilators. By the end of May, the initial mass production will have added 1,500 life-saving oxygen providers to the estimated 5,000 ventilators for adults currently in use in the country’s hospitals.

Because the developers used open source techniques, other factories are able to add production capacity if necessary.

Until now, nobody in Colombia had the technology to produce these complex machines that aren’t even available in hospitals in the poorest parts of the country.

This is GREAT news for Colombia and Latin America!

Depends what your normal is.

Will you be going back to concerts any time soon? Doubt it.

Will restaurants, bars, and gyms open up? Yes, but probably with restrictions on seating, availability and number of people that can be in them.

Likely by the summertime (July, August) in most places you'll see a semblance of what life was like before the coronavirus, but it'll still be changed.

Don't know if this is allowed comment or not; bit right now there's a huge crowd outside the state capital demanding for our governor to open the state back up, demanding to get back to work, when we're not supposed to be gathering in groups. He's trying to address the state and let us know the death toll today and they're chanting through megaphones and blasting air horns over top of his address.

They're screaming let freedom ring

Edit; during their tirade they called him a King Dictator when he's been nothing but benevolent during his whole term.

Can we make a list of companies, people, and organizations that are giving financial aid...and pin it at the top? I know David Doubrik, PUBG (yes, the game), H3H3, Jefree Star, etc are giving fans money, and honestly, those $500 can really make a difference, whether that's groceries or medication, etc. There's also local city governments which have their own initiatives, like the city of Tampa is paying people's rent/mortgage in with their Rise Together program.

This is a hell of a video from a hospital outside Moscow (in Khimki), apparently recorded four days ago, where a paramedic says his ambulance had to wait nine hours in a huge line (watch the footage) before dropping off their COVID-19 patient.

After this whole thing is over.. I do hope a majority of the Healthcare workers end up with a HUGE amount of paid vacation. Like say around 2-3 months. Because a good majority of them are likely going to need it, and also will end up a ton of PTSD from it.

Our governor (Reeves, MS), announced all public schools are to be closed for the rest of the school year. Finally the south is playing catch-up with the rest of the states and countries that already announced schools will be closed for the remainder of the academic year.

Possible, but unlikely. The majority of people do recover from coronavirus and the virus mutates slowly. Both of these indicate that it should be possible to create a vaccine. We have something like 70 vaccine candidates under development right now.

Yikes! Data Scientist/modeler here. Just noticed that the deaths today for Italy are even higher than the 95% confidence intervals of predictions from IMHE models, and close to the higher end for Spain. This is very very bad for the US.

Meaning that the decline in number deaths per day from the peak is much slower than they had predicted - I'm guessing this is because a less rigorous lockdown than South Korea/Wuhan (which is the only real death-decline data they had) is much less effective in slowing the spread than they anticipated.

Expect the IMHE forecast to be revised significantly upwards soon from the 68K number, and this is with full social distancing till May 31, which ain't happening.

2482 deaths. Most deaths so far in a single day for this disease.

And New York just recorded, with the evening update, it's largest single day new cases ever at 11,525.

I don't think we are at peak yet, or at best, we are at a bad plateau.

My state, Michigan had a stay at home protest called #operationgridlock. This is disturbing for so many reasons. They filled the State Capital’s streets with cars saying they would maintain social distancing protocols, however they didn’t, they got out of cars and many flaunted the fact that they didn’t have masks. They blocked off the streets so much so that the EMS could not get through to the hospital and a chemo center had at risk patients who could not make it in. They harassed some POC in their way home, had a bunch of misspelled protest signs in true hillbilly fashion, Trump signs and confederate flags. The same people who said that Kaepernick was wrong for kneeling during the national anthem during the most inappropriate time were the same ones out here protesting the fact that they can’t walk into a garden aisle to buy seeds while blocking ambulances. Welcome to America everybody.

PS. It snowed in Michigan today.

How did people survive the Great Depression/World Wars and not get depressed/traumatized for life?

Is there any historical event in recent history that I can draw coping methods from?

How do I deal with more than one major stressor in life? My coping method I'd usually "push through", but without a concrete end in sight, it's hard to ration my energy.

What more can I do to help speed up the recovery process for the world?

Where do you guys go for socialization/meeting new people in this time? (I don't know if I actually need this yet, but this seems like good info to have before I become too insane to ask for it.)

What else can I do to alleviate boredom besides working out and gaming and school?

How do you guys get privacy when you're at home with others? I might need to call a counselor soon and I don't want anyone to eavesdrop.

How did we get into this situation in the first place?

What is being done to prevent similar situations happening in the future? This better be "once in a lifetime event" Depending on how much energy this takes out of me, I might not make it through if some major worldwide crisis happens again in like 2030 or something.

What is the "light at the end of the tunnel?" I feel like one of the only positives right now is that I don't have the disease.

How the bloody hell will I deal if I get the disease if I can barely hold myself together right now?

There's too much uncertainty. I need something to cling to. Please :(.

Using data on excess mortality compared to normal and the fact that 3% of blood donors that were tested over the past few weeks is carrying anti-bodies, the COVID-19 morbitity in the Netherlands is now estimated at 1.2%. It also tells us that confirmed case count is only about 5% of the actual number of infections. There are still some caveats, but in terms of order of magnitude it provides us with a better idea than we had until now.

Happening right now in my state. A stupid protest of the stay at home order. The news coverage in the link (the video that is 7:35 long, there are multiple videos in link) shows 100-150 people outside of their cars on the Capital lawn.

My question is this, how are none of these people being arrested? Every single person on that lawn within arms distance of each other is breaking the law.

Michigan State Police said that as of 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time no arrests had been made.

Was reading that Italian doctors are now saying to treat for blood clots as the real mortality threat as opposed to pneumonia, but I take all news with a grain of salt? Anyone hear anything to confirm or debunk this? If this is true then does that mean we have been treating it all wrong and ventilators don't really do much?

Do people not think about the stories they post? There's a few "viral by design" (no pun intended) stories on the frontpage that has little to do with articles about research, policies, numbers, actions, etc.

A lot of those stories look like things you share on Facebook, but all it seems to do is just generate a ton of "HE DESERVED IT" kinda posts (aka mob justice).

Can someone expand on what exactly recovery entails? Does your body kill the virus and get rid of it? Then you're theoretically immune and no longer a spreader?

What about asymptomatic carriers/spreaders? When would they "recover"?

Just to be clear up front: most of your questions are unanswerable right now. However, I will try to venture some insight.

In the case of most viruses in this subgroup (other corona viruses, and cousin strains of it), immunity after recovery is fairly well established, suggesting that someone who has recovered from covid would not be at risk of contracting it again (at this point nobody knows if that immunity is permanent or temporary, but without viral mutation, it would typically be a significant amount of time).

In general virology, your antibodies would sustain for quite a while, preventing you from recurring infection (and therefore your ability to spread to others), but nothing is an absolute at this point.

The shorter answer is that antibody testing is vital on a massive scale ASAP, because recovered patients will be generally assumed as non-carriers and as non-vectors.

Hope this made some sense,

Anyone find it weird how excited and amped some people get about how Corona is shutting the world down? Most of the comments from these type of people fail to show any signs of sympathy for the people affected and more so excitement for the lack of normalcy in our world.

Some people seem to be excited about quarantine for the wrong reasons and they seem to “hope” this situation is going to get worse and last the rest of the year. If anything, we should hope a vaccine gets implemented quickly and the virus goes dormant long enough for the vaccine to arrive before the 2nd wave.

I had a tele-visit with one of my doctors yesterday. I made a generic comment about coronavirus in our area. He rolled his eyes and told me he thought social distancing and the shut down of businesses was a huge overreaction. He also said he wasn't worried about it spreading, as "most people will be a little sick for a few days and then be fine".

I was, to put it mildly, surprised. I now wonder how many other medical professionals feel this way?

Regardless, I'm still staying home, wearing a mask when I need to go out and disinfecting items I bring into the house.

Yeah this guy is a bad doctor.

A lot of people in the medical profession unfortunatley have not thought very deeply about epidemiology, public health, or viruses, since medical school.

And they are now being bad representatives of their profession.

Listen to the CDC, listen to the NIH. Listen to Dr. Fauci. Seriously not all doctors are created equal and not all doctors actually know stuff about viruses and how viral spread/hospital over-crowding/pandemics actually work.

Lots of people hating on WHO. Decided to dig into it, never paid much attention to WHO before.

Here's what I learned.

First, the good news. WHO was mainly formed as a way to combat infectious disease. WHOs greatest achievement is the eradication of small pox. Yaaaay go WHO!

Now the bad news. WHOs a mess of complex beaurcracy. Not that surprising honestly. WHO is playing into the Chinese demand to not recognize Taiwan as a country or allow them a seat in the organization. BOOO bad WHO!

My personal opinion. Most of the hateful comments about WHO are coming from people caught up in the blame game, lashing out at any entity that seems blame worthy as a reaction to the stress caused by the pandemic. Plus were conversing through internet comments, lashing out is like 90% of what people use them for.

I’m a PTSD sufferer and agoraphobic. I haven’t grocery shopped or left my home in over two years. It’s not that I -want- to stay inside forever, just that every time I consider going out, I have to think about “what if this outing costs me my life?” It’s something watching the world move towards my normal. If I’m behaving like everyone else, am I still considered “mentally ill?”

How are we ever supposed to really slow the spread of COVID19? Just looking at the stats, it looks like we've been doing over 2300 deaths the past day or so, which is up from what the IHME model is.

30,000+ new cases nationwide.

Open protests in MI over stay-at-home orders.

On top of that the fed gov wants to get things going again.

With all of this going on, how do you really lower that 30k+ cases per day number?

It just seems like we're doing exactly what people did when the spanish flu hit philadelphia in 1918. Oddly similar.

And that 30k per day might be due to hitting limit on daily performed tests.

How to slow down the spread is not so hard... the issues is that USA is pretty much the worst possible place to implement it. Mandatory mask wearing and making it illegal for more than 2 people to meet up if they are not coworkers or share a household. In worst case even stopping almost all production. Single use gloves in every store. Making hours when grocery stores can be used only by old people to limit the contact with the most vulnerable group... equipping everyone with ordered quarantine with ankle bracelet to make sure they are not going outside.

All of these measures have been implemented to some degree in several countries around thee World and they helped limit the spread. But can people in the US go through with it without riots? Without screaming about dictatorship? Would many US politicians have the courage to implement such policies even?

I’ll be honest, this is what I feared, cases hover at a pretty significant number, and with no end in sight people start to protest the stay at home orders.

I think the stay at home orders stop, but unfortunately the longer this goes on, I think the more protests and unrest we’ll find, even in liberal areas.

I just don't get why people aren't taking this thing serious. I get the whole politics thing, but seriously this is a pandemic. Looking at all the docs from the Spanish flu period has me kind of freaking out.

And we can't even compare the US to Italy, Spain or China - They have been able to lock down for the most part. The stay at home orders being done around the country are barely being enforced.

Does anyone know where there might be some additional information on what would happen if you contracted covid19 while pregnant? I'm 26 weeks and pretty much terrified... I have only left the house once for an appointment and I have to work on site at my office with 10 other people next week who are very spread out. Would it be wise to try and go on maternity leave earlier or just see what happens with our state's stay at home order (I'm in Pennsylvania). Also, I have heard from a few others who are expecting that their OBGYN is recommending that they induce labor at 39 weeks without any other reason other than covid19... I'm sure that varies from doctor to doctor but that seems unnecessary and dangerous. If I were to contract covid19 in the hospital, would I still be able to see my baby and or breastfeed? I've read you can still breastfeed if you were to become positive...

Belgium is now the hardest hit country in terms of deaths per million inhabitants (excluding microstates). Why is there so little discussion of the situation there? I don't see anyone discussing this fact on Reddit or in the media. Even in my own country, which borders Belgium, media are not reporting much on it. I am genuinely curious why that is. Why are they being hit so hard? How has the response been inside Belgium?

I had heard that some believe the older BCG vaccine may provide some degree of protection from coronavirus. This got me thinking: Is it possible that another vaccine normally given to children is actually offering some protection as well? Children do not seem to be suffering much from this except for infants. Could this be not just because of their youth, but because they have been more recently vaccinated than adults and the elderly? Is there a vaccine normally given early in life, whose effects wear off with time, that could be protecting children from the effects of COVID-19?

I'm not a medical expert by any means, so I could be way off. Just was thinking and wondering.

How restricted are you in lockdown in your country? We in South Africa are not allowed to walk a dog or go jogging. Our supermarkets have stopped selling cigarettes and alcohol and also are not allowed to sell household appliances i.e. a kettle or toaster. Our main online shopping site only sells essentials for working at home i.e. printed ink and paper. You can't even buy a new DVD to watch. Edit: cellphone typos

Peru here

Walking dogs is fine as long as it’s done in the immediate proximity of your house

Curfew from 18:00 to 04:00

Only 1 person per family is allowed to leave the house for essential purposes like buying food, meds or financial transactions

Supermarkets also stopped selling alcohol even if it’s not prohibited which IMO is utterly dumb.

All restaurants are closed, almost no delivery services are working

On sundays, no one is allowed to leave the house

I live in New York. I’m a teen from Long Island, and my mom is a doctor who has been assigned to the covid-19 floor. She said that there is slightly less cases, but the death toll is rising. Because of this, when do you think New York schools will actually be back. I’m curious as to when because I’ve been doing online schooling for the past month. If you have an idea of when schools may be back it would be great if you could lmk. To anyone reading this. Stay safe <3

Has anyone else noticed worsening mental illness symptoms with this illness? My mother and I both have dry coughs, fever, body aches, etc. But more horribly, we’ve both gone batshit. I have panic disorder, anxiety disorder, depression, and adhd. She has anxiety and depression and what we believe is bipolar.

Today I keep getting overwhelmed by a most horrific and unbearable depression and fear to the point that I was finding any way to stop being conscious. Then immediately afterward I’m struck by a total emotional numbness to the point that I’ll just lay there doing nothing for an hour.

She has been drinking despite being sick because she can’t cope with how insane she feels. We were relatively functioning individuals before and now I feel like I’ve completely snapped. I’m confused, afraid, and my emotions have never been more volatile. I’ve heard confusion mentioned but has anyone else noticed this kind of worsening mental and emotional health? I’m struggling with suicidal thoughts just because I can’t stand being conscious. I have never felt like the inside of my brain was this f***ing bizarre.

2,000,000 cases reached already (according to JH map). Surprised I haven't seen a thread on it. It took 13 days to double in size, crazy, BUT it only achieved that so fast by us hitting new daily case records each day in lat march/ early April, now that we are trending downwards on daily cases it'll take much longer to reach 3M.

Bets on days till 3M? 14 days? 21? Do I hear 10?

What I do, if it helps you:

Have 5 masks.

Wear 1 mask/day.

Rotate them.

Such that by the time you get back to the first mask, it's been sitting around in open air and light for 5 days.

(not direct sunlight , btw, this could degrade the mask)

Leave them in a sealed ziplock baggie on the dashboard of a car in hot sun for a couple weeks and you still can't certify that they're sterile, but you can be sure you're clear of this virus and the vast majority of other pathogens and the risk gets pretty low compared to no PPE.

Yes, however, the issue is that single use PPE isn't designed to be used long-term. Depending on how much you use it, you will wear it out and have a higher chance of particles getting through a tear or worn out surface. If you have no better option, it's still better than nothing.

I'm very curious to see what the messaging will be from government leaders about leaving your house after SIP is lifted in most areas. It seems like the virus doesn't spread as well outside as it does indoors, so it seems prudent to encourage people to socialize outdoors rather than indoors when they can, but I think encouraging people to socialize at all could be dangerous as well. But then if you don't properly message to people how to socialize safely, many will do it anyway but without proper distancing, or do it indoors where the virus spreads more easily, and it could be worse than if you had promoted taking precautions. I'm not sure which way is better, but it's going to a very fine line to walk.

Just wondering if anyone with more knowledge than me can weigh in on this:

All of these various models that are being used - IHME, Imperial college, etc - aren’t they basically worthless because we have no idea how many actual cases / deaths we have?

Even in Europe and the USA, confirmed case / death data is grossly underestimated. China’s data is highly questionable. Other places, like India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Sub-Saharan Africa are barely testing; we have no idea what the actual impact is in much of the world.

So how are we modeling a disease with such incomplete data?

It's to be expected. The people dying today were infected around 20 days ago. So it will continue to increase given the number of infected has increased over the last 20 days. If the peak is today, we will see the number of deaths start to flatten and eventually fall 20 days from now.

Noob here. Why tests per capita is considered more important than the total number of tests?

The US tops the charts with most number of tests carried out, but it stands much lower in per-capita testing ratio.

Does this mean anything?

(not a virologist but if I understood correctly) the lipohillicity of just about any decent soap that works at all will work wonders to dissolve the viral envelopes. Sars Cov II just isn't all that hardy of a virus in that sense.

Any soap - body soap, shampoo, dish soap, even foot soap will work. The idea is not to kill the virus, but to wash it down the drain. Soap makes your skin slick, allowing bacteria and viruses to slide off. Once you've scrubbed and rinsed really well, drying is also important! Use a paper towel whenever possible, dry well, and throw the used towel away. Bye, bye!

I can offer one of the coolest and most informative episodes of MythBusters that I have ever seen! It's about washing your hands!

I'm terrified of getting it because I have vulnerable family members and I know every time I go out, I'm at a risk for getting it just because I'm walking among the general population. I went to the post office wearing gloves but I had to take my gloves off in order to put a package together I was mailing and when I walked out of the post office, there was a huge group of people standing together and I walked right past them. I've had paid time off from work but they're going to want me to go back soon and im going to have to make a decision of whether i keep my job and put myself at risk each day or quit and not have my paychecks coming in and protect myself.

There are studies out now that show that cloth masks (with 4 layers) block less than 20% of particles, and to actually make a decent mask, you'd need to use shit like coffee filters - which are really hard to breath through.

That's the point, do you think N95 medical grade is pleasant to wear?

The main reason for non medical worker to wear any facecover is, if you are infected but asymptomatic you will dish out the virus when you breath, when you talk, and when you cough. Wearing any facecover helps your virus stays with you.

Wearing mask to protect others.

I had a family member pass away last night due to something unrelated to covid-19, today my gf called off of work so that we could meet with immediate family and mourn. After she called out they told her she is not allowed to be back for 2 weeks and must quarantine during this time even though she has not been in contact with anyone that has covid 19. They are not giving her pay. We live in FL and she works for a veterinarian small business owner. Are they allowed to force her to quarantine from work with no pay during this time?

It might not block all droplets coming through the cloth, but it can block some, and it acts as a physical barrier. Most COVID infections are transferred from touching your face/eyes/mouth. A homemade mask acts as an additional barrier to protect your face.

Question about the physical testing process. Is getting a nasal swab for the virus similar to getting a nasal swab for the flu? I'm not well educated in how viral testing works or if they're different at all but the idea of a long swab going to the back of my nose makes my gut twist. I'll do it if I have to either way, but I'm curious if they're similar because I've had nasal swabs for the flu before as a kid. If it'll be like that, it doesn't seem quite as scary.

Hate to confirm your fears, but I found the nasal swab test to be highly uncomfortable. When they shoved it up my nostril I was immediately like "oh sh!t, there's a cavity up THERE?! That feels insanely close to my eyeball! Oh god this burns! Say what, I've got another 25sec of this hell?!"

Definitely made that particular nostril feel weird for the next 3 days (kinda had me wishing they had done both so it didn't feel so weird) and I felt really uncomfortable/anxious whenever I would think about the testing procedure.

I think I have coronavirus. Is it normal to experience the symptoms in waves? Mostly I just have the shortness of breath and fatigue. Sometimes I have a low grade fever. I almost would attribute this to seasonal allergies but I'm not congested and this is like nothing I've ever experienced.

My lungs hurt. At the worst it feels like I've just taken a sprint in the cold air.

I've talked to my doctor and they presume I have it. I went to get screened for a test but since I only have mild symptoms I didn't meet the criteria to get a test.

I don’t really think it has anything to do with that. If you get it, your body fights it or it doesn’t. The reason we are closing down is because the healthcare system is overwhelmed and if to many people get it at one time, the healthcare workers might have to make decisions anout who gets a ventilator and who doesn’t (or..who lives and who dies) NO ONE wants to make that choice... it becomes an ethical issue.

I will genuinely be shocked if less than a million Americans die from this.

Right now you have 30k death with 640k confirmed cases. That’s 4.6% deaths from confirmed cases.

Most countries are predicting 70-90% infection rates and of your almost 330m population, even 4.5% of 70% of them is putting you in seriously f***ing scary numbers. Middlegrounding it 4.5% of 80% of your population is over 11 million people. (I can’t see it getting that high hopefully).

4.5% seems scarily higher than other western first world nations, but at the same time the US is really the only western first world nation with a non existent national health system and a government totally f***ing unwilling to do anything to stop the spread and economically support people to stay at home.

I know this might sound stupid but i just wanna gauge how royally f***ed we are for expectations. While it is not highly lethal it is highly contagious and lethal to those who have a weak immune system. the economy is f***ed and if it says f***ed we might have another depression but if we open too soon we have another Spanish flu. So, should i genuinely be preparing to fear for hard times or just wait till this blows over and hope for the best? i haven't heard anything about a vaccine being closer to development but i have most certainly heard of more cases and deaths.

Can't hurt to prepare for hard times, but this does have a benefit that other depressions didn't have - there will be a vaccine that can let us all back out again eventually. It's not a drought or war or some calamity with an unknown duration. If I had to put money on it, I'd say we open up too early in May or June, have a few weeks of calm until the infection time bomb hits again... and then we do this whole lockdown dance one more time while we play whack-a-mole with more hotspots and preventable deaths.

Too soon to tell how soon anything will open up properly, but serious global recession is pretty much guaranteed already. The heaviest hit will be service industry and areas like airbnb, which will cause big ripples on the real estate market.

If you live in a country where you can be easily fired at any moment, then expect hard times. Countries where it is harder to fire people and that have government programs that help businesses keep going (Paying part of salary of workers in times they cannot work) will be probably able to bounce back faster.

No, I think if it isn’t cured by a vaccine, maybe the most vulnerable wear a mask, but everyone else just goes back to treating it like a bad case of the flu.

At some point, people will totally quit giving a shit about this virus if it’s 2 years from now, no vaccine exists, and it’s clear it never will

Hey Reddit, first post here and hope for some constructive and collaborative answers. I just saw a recent interview in which the mayor of LA & NYC remarked that larger social gatherings would be one of the last things to come online and would likely only be done in 2021.

My questions to you are as follow?

Do you feel this is realistic, not only from a time perspective but also a public patience/adherence standpoint? I personally feel with summer coming up, the potential lift of certain states self lockdowns, and the public’s angst to get out that this is highly unlikely.

I am curious to know your views on the overall decision to open the economy. I agree health should be at the forefront and safety it the priority. However, from a fiscal standpoint, how long can the country and the economy stay closed.

With lockdown restrictions being lifted in the imminent future, how will certain businesses be able to survive such as restaurants at 50% capacity or even a much more massive operation like Disney theme parks?

Thanks for any replies and I really hope with all the negativity, we can get some positive answers. Stay safe and look forward to reading/viewing the posts

I’m probably a bit paranoid, but any advice would be appreciated. My regular temp is 97.8 on a given day, I’ve had a headache all day, have had sort of labored breathing only at night on and off for the last week or so, and I just checked my temp and it was 99.1. I know that isn’t considered a “fever,” but since it is more than 1 degree higher than my typical temperature should I be concerned?

Do you normally have labored breathing? Can you get your hands on an oximeter to check your O2 level? Check CVS/Walgreens. If your O2 is below 91-92, head to hospital. If not continue to monitor.

Hey guys. I've got a pretty important question!

How do I take care of groceries that I order from outside?

They arrive inside a cardboard box. What my mom does is leave the box in a corner for a day and then disinfect the groceries inside it with a disinfectant liquid by washing it, except for those types of groceries which are uncovered.

Is this the best way? Or is there another?

From what I've heard and read the virus almost exclusively spreads from person to person via droplets and aerosol from coughing/breathing/talking.

Keeping your distance and following basic hygiene - not touching your face, no smoking, no eating in public places and washing hands as soon as you get home - should do the vast amount of risk reduction. Everything else seems just excessive to me.

In addition, distancing and hygiene-etiquette also keeps everyone self save, excessively disinfecting everything (as a substitute) only yourself.

Should also be noted that "patients who were put on ventilators show permanent lung damage" does not necessarily mean "ventilators cause permanent lung damage". It could very well mean "patients who were severely affected by the virus, so much that they needed a ventilator, showed permanent lung damage". Though I would love some source that (dis)proves me so that I can correct any preconceived notion.

Doctors were talking about ventilators in general, not necessarily in the case of COVID-19. The mechanical process of the ventilator does damage to the lungs, that's what doctors are explaining, on top of the lung damage the virus does.

So it seems like the plan will be to gradually reopen with no mass testing and...hope for the best? Kinda damned no matter what you do in this situation.

Between obesity, hypertension, old age, etc at least like over a third of the pop has vulnerabilities.

At least we've avoided the massive influx at once so the healthcare system can function it appears.

It’s really just going to come down to this (I think):

-more people get sick and die -our economy completely collapses and everyone is shit out of luck.

Let’s keep at-risk people locked down. Let’s get healthy/even recovered people back out in industry. Let’s try to ramp up production of PPE for hospitals.

Let’s carefully pull back these restrictions such that we can keep our economy alive while minimizing the burden on our medical infrastructure.

States are pretty reluctant at the moment. We will see who caves in because of money reasons and who holds out until they feel comfortable with their testing capabilities.

I don’t get why nobody is bringing up the lack of testing from the CDC. The US had a confirmed case towards the end of January in which a guy in his 30s had a serious case. From the end of January to the end of February the CDC tested about 445 people nationwide. Hospitals were outright denying tests unless you traveled from hotspots in China.

If you mean deliberate manslaughters, yes. Prevention of testing was a key to the "get it over with" strategy. The doctor in the first confirmed US case had to put her medical license on the line to get her patients tested.

I posted this as a reply to another comment but I thought it was interesting to show anyone looking at this thread:

It's a nightmare scenario: An infectious disease is spreading around the world and threatening to topple civilization as we know it. But what kind of disease could do this?

"We need to get serious about respiratory viruses," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, who led the report. "[There's] a lot of focus on diseases that aren't going to be able to change civilization in a way that something that's spread through the respiratory route would be."

I think that this event has brought a lot of veiled racism to the frontline. If the people have shown no racism in the past and don’t originally have racism in their minds then they wouldn’t resort to racially driven actions and words.

On top, we have to have awareness of where the racism is stemming from too since a lot of it is coming from either:

-sheer ignorance (example: not buying Chinese food but still buying Italian food)

-racist ideology — racism existed already even before this and it shows in their extreme reactions and quickness to resort to this behavior (example: physically assaulting people as they are the race you target)

-systemic scapegoating (example: district in China is kicking black students out of dorms accusing them and Africa in general for spreading the virus when there’s no proof of this)

Hi everyone,

Data is coming out that asymptomatic carriers are roughly 75% of all people with COVID-19 (see links below) if that is the case, the true mortality rate is likely .25% (assuming actual mortality rate of 2% of symptomatic individuals). If this is the case, how does it change our strategies to combat COVID-19?

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2020/04/14/small-new-study-in-pregnant-women-may-provide-clues-about-coronavirus-infection-rate/amp/

https://www.google.com/amp/s/fortune.com/2020/04/15/china-most-asymptomatic-coronavirus-carriers-never-get-sick/amp/

I’m genuinely puzzled as to what the case should be. Obviously serology tests must be ramped up, but with this all in mind, is the Swedish model the correct way forward (as unfortunate as it is). Are we just delaying the inevitable?

Have been social distancing for a over a month now and I’m glad its going well and everyone in my family is safe and healthy. When I practice social distancing, I feel proud cause I am doing my part. I am surprised I have managed to stay at home for this long. It gets tough at times and yes its a bit hard getting work done but I enjoy it alot. This is the most I will spend with my family. Though I hope things can return to normal one day.

Stay safe everyone. Love you all!!

Not sure where to post this, but I live in a brownstone in NYC and my downstairs neighbors (husband and wife in their 40s with a 3 year old) do not seem to be leaving the building AT ALL. Like, I've seen mail down there for days. Their child has a temper tantrum every several hours and I don't blame her! People are taking this too far! They should go out for walks. In the meantime, I hear other kids who have backyard access playing all day long having a great time. The parents are teachers, too. Just seems like a miserable existence. I feel bad for them.

Hey, Everyone. I am writing to say something good in this fricked-up time, we will get through this as a society, we gotten through everything else, wars, depressions, terrorist attacks, and much more. If you're feeling scared, it's OK! I pray for those who've lost things to this plague such as their jobs, loved ones, and are in a place of uncertainty, I have hope for the world, it's healing from the strain we've put on it for the longest time, with the air-pollution levels going down, and animals returning to their original habitats, ecosystems being healed from the constant hunting, it's going to be OK! If you feel scared, worried, angry, or any other unsavory emotion, feel free to message me, just if you want to chat! :) Have a good day!

I don’t think the “peak” means what some of you think it means. It’s not a halfway point where things get better after we reach it. There will be significantly more death after the peak than there was up to and including the peak. Italy “peaked a while ago and they have had 16-17 500+ deaths and they have a long MFing way to go.

As a US citizen, I’m interested to know how COVID-19 is affecting countries that my government has been having a heavy effect on in the Middle East, especially Yemen, Libya, and Syria.

Specifically,

Yemen: how is it affecting the cholera epidemic and supply shortages there?

Libya: has this impacted the booming human trafficking trade there, or the conflict at all?

Syria: how are the Syrian government and rebel groups responding to it?

Call the doctor. Could be safe to go to an orthopedic doctor's office that's not taking otherwise sick patients, but I have no idea. Talk to a medical professional.

If she thinks she broke it and needs to go to the ER, again call first and ask their advice.

Go to the ER as soon as possible.

Seriously if your friend is under 45, or even under 50, the risks of getting Coronavirus are definitely outweighed by the risks of loss of mobility later in life if her foot doesn't heal correctly.

If you have access and insurance coverage at a genuine orthopedist or sports medicine office, that would likely be a better alternative.

Masks. Avoid mass gatherings. Start up restaurants and bars only slowly. Buff up the healthcare system.

Whatever we do...trust me...the world cannot afford another lockdown. Doing this as a one-off is one thing. If, after loosening methods, we have to have more, that will be catastrophic because of the uncertainty alone. And remember, social distancing =/= lockdown.

If you ask me, I'm optimistic, honestly. If more than an entire month of covid spreading unchecked in NYC and infecting, by even conservative estimates, around 15-20% of the population only "barely" managed to overwhelm a completely unprepared healthcare system...I think a better prepared one will weather the storm most places taking social distancing measures into account.

Worse how? Take a look at cases or fatalities per million. Then take a look at tests per million. The US is not doing great but nowhere near as bad as you might be led to believe. The US is nearly the size of Europe. Most cities are absolutely fine. NY and some surrounding areas are now being crushed.

But yes, some of the problem is absolutely American arrogance.

r/ChurchOfCorona is a new subreddit dedicated to the remembrance of those lost to the virus and our struggle against it. We have one religous holiday per year, Zoonotic day. The church believes the first Tuesday of November 2019 is the probable date of the Zoonotic transfer of the Coronavirus from a bat in Wyuhan to a human. On this holy holiday we will remain at home all day to remember those lost and the struggle we all endured during the great quarantine.

Part of our church mission is to assist those in the church with exercising their religious belief while exercising their civic duty of voting. Because the holy day coincides with the national election day, this unfortunately means we will not be able to vote at a crowded polling place and will need a religious exemption to vote with an absentee ballot.

Peace and health be with you all.

We just got his death certificate and it is listed as complications from Covid 19, even though his test was negative??

Louisiana too. They're at 1,103 and their quota is 1,141. With 90 for today. They're not going to make it through tomorrow at this pace.

Did I miss my opportunity or will it come later on once my taxes and direct deposit process? Or is there something additional I need to do now?

It's usually a nasopharyngeal swab, meaning they shove a long rigid Q-tip down your nose until it hits the back of your throat.

It is definitely very uncomfortable while they're down there, moving that thing around. But it's also pretty quick. Very similar to the best and most accurate kind of flu test if you've ever had that done. (not the "rapid" kind)

Is anyone a little bit confused on comparisons between death tolls based on confirmed vs estimated deaths? From doing a little research it seems that all the death numbers people cite from prior flu seasons or the h1n1 pandemic are numbers calculated from mathematical models based on estimates. It seems that the actual confirmed deaths is a lot lower than the after the fact estimate (sometimes by a factor of 10 or more). So, why then are people comparing specific American flu seasons based on the after the fact estimate to the current death tolls that are most likely undercounted?

It just seems like it doesn’t make any sense to me. And it also seems like the after the fact estimate for deaths from covid-19 has the possibility of very high considering that there have been no so many confirmed deaths already.

It's basically impossible to have an accurate death rate until the pandemic has run its course and all those missed deaths can be accounted for. If you want a more in-depth discussion, I'd recommend you read this: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

This is worse than the flu. Anyone pushing that idea has an agenda. Or they are getting a lot of misinformation from others pushing an agenda. We could have informed discussions about how serious this disease actually is and how that should inform policy. But we need to first ask for adequate testing so we can have accurate data!

I've been using this sure for a long time. It now shows daily increase, percentage increase and you can compare states as well as countries and can toggle aligning by 100th case or per million population. It's pretty useful. Not affiliated but I keep hearing people say they have to go to excel to get a daily weighted average and this guy does that already on the website.

Does anyone know what the cleaning measures for the original SARS was? Reason I ask is because I feel confused by the extra caution of places sterilizing the outside world. For example, the videos of all those trucks spraying disinfectant all over the place in China. After watching the California update yesterday, Newsom started talking about deep cleaning schools, buses, parks, benches, etc. It just seems a bit overboard to me so was curious if this ever happened before.

I think in certain rural areas of the United States (states that went into lockdown early) we may see some restrictions being lifted by mid-May. End of May for many other locations. That's not to say that we are all heading to a sporting event anytime soon but we may see restaurants and other amenities having limited openings.

Rural areas won’t have their peaks until much later. If anything, lockdowns for rural areas was premature, and ending them sooner rather than extending them is a likely mistake.

Way more likely to be false negatives. The nasopharyngeal swab test becomes very unreliable especially as the disease takes its course. The virus moves down to the larynx and into the lungs and becomes undetectable in previous locations leading to a higher incidence of false negatives. We need to start doing IgM antibody tests to see if someone is positive because they become more reliable as the disease progresses. Just my thought though —> viruses that remain latent usually do so by invading nerves and remaining latent in those nerves until stress produces an outbreak (like shingles or HSV). TB which also lays dormant because it can cause granulomas to form. The coronavirus as far as I know is not capable of either of these mechanisms.

SC's cases seem to be going down everyday. I don't know if that's a lack of testing or protective measures working. Did a massive grocery trip today and saw 90% of people wearing masks and everyone seemed to distance themselves. Seems at least a majority of people have taken this seriously.

I am curious if other people are experiencing this... I live in Michigan and because of our ‘Stay Home’ order there are many more people walking outside in my neighborhood (which is nice), however the amount of litter in my community must have quadrupled! I don’t know why but Lysol wipes keep ending up in my bushes, I’ve seen several face masks in my lawn and even cardboard boxes keep winding up on the street! This is not normal; it’s just infuriating! I personally feel endangered when throwing this stuff out but on the other hand I can’t stand watching it fly away to stay out in nature!

My wife and I reached out to a non profit that does clean ups. They’re obviously not doing group clean ups but they let us borrow some gear (gloves and grabbers) to pick up litter. Could be worth trying I wouldn’t pick any of that stuff up without protective gear even without corona.

Yes, same here in my NY suburb. People are throwing masks and gloves all over the ground (especially in grocery store parking lots despite extra trash cans being set up for that exact purpose). And some people seem to have forgotten how to clean up after their dogs (or they don't usually walk their dogs in "normal" times and don't realize they need to pick up poop?).

Sorry about your dad. Keep it in the account and don’t touch it. It’s an advance payment on a tax credit for 2020 taxes. So more than likely she will end up needing to adjust her 2020 tax return by that amount.

Hello. I have a question in hope someone can answer. My mother is overweight, on the border to obese and a smoker. Are here any people who are overweight and smoking, who haven't had any complications or a visit to the hospital?

She was exposed to someone postitive and I'm very scared right now. I'm always reading it's a death sentence for smokers or overweight people.

Hi

This is not a black or white scenario. Your mother has probably a much worse starting point than others, but such is not necessarily a death sentence. Human bodies are very complex organisms, and this virus has many variables. There are other factors like virus load, etc., and patients react differently.

Should you be concerned: yes.

Is your mother more compromised than others: yes

Is she going to die if she gets infected: hopefully not, but nobody can tell right now. It depends on so many factors it is really impossible to know now.

My point is , there is no sense in overthinking right now. Be concerned, please keep calm and have trust/faith.

My thoughts are with you and your family, please stay strong, I wish you the best.

Quick question about exposure. I do home inspections. I met a customer earlier today that her husband was diagnosed on March 10th with Covid-19. He is ok now and quarantined like he was supposed to. Both she and him tested negative on March 25th. She hasn't had any symptoms and is a former nurse so cleaned and sanitized regularly and took many precautions.

I met with her today. It was outside and I was wearing gloves and kept my distance. She did sign something on my phone and I have since sanitized it. I also sanitized my hands many times.

What are the chances do you think I could have been exposed? Am I paranoid or should I be ok with all things considering?

You're probably being paranoid, it has been over a month since he was infected and they both tested negative almost 3 weeks ago. She very likely did not have it, and even if she did, she wasn't coughing, which is a primary vector for COVID transmission. Then, you sanitized your phone. I'm sure you're fine

two questions - 1) who do you contact to volunteer for any kind of testing that may be beneficial to research going towards covid-19? donating blood/plasma of survivors as well as people looking for information on how it interacts with different drugs?

2) anyone know anything about TNF inhibitors helping people recover from covid-19? I read this paper but am by no means a medical professional who understands all the fancy words and was wondering if anyone had seen any other articles regarding it.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30858-8/fulltext

I'm especially curious about this because I'm immunosuppressed and take TNF inhibitors, and have been really sick for the past month. my doctor's thought I had covid-19, going as far as to diagnose me with it despite my first test coming back negative, and I've since had a second test read negative as well that has left my doctors pretty confused and branding it as bronchitis, but with much uncertainty. I started showing major symptoms the evening of my infusion (I got it done in the morning) with diarrhea the night before, and the following day I began the whole schebang of dry coughing, low fevers, body aches, loss of taste and smell, wheezing, chest pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, etc that has continued now, a month later. after my first test came back negative I was diagnosed with covid-19 anyways based off of clinical analysis and support from various doctors, and sent for testing a second time which came back negative and has left them confused. I'm doing much better than I was at first (all chest x-rays have been clear) and have remained in quarantine long before I got sick, and my doctors want to test my blood in the future to see if I did carry it after all. I'm curious though if there's anything I can do to help researchers, or anything I can do to help the cause at all really, but don't know how to find anything out!

How is Poland doing so well keeping the virus in check? Their testing numbers are near the bottom of the list but their death counts are incredibly low. Are they just getting ramped up or did they lock down quickly enough to avoid the catastrophe sweeping most of Western Europe?

I think the spread of the virus started in their country later than the rest of Europe, but they locked down at the same time as the rest of the European countries. This would mean the virus has less of a chance at spreading. I’m not exactly sure if that is the reason. But that is what it seems to be.

Poland issued all ban on international travel and locked up borders when they were still at only dozens of cases. The same goes for Slovakia, Czech Republic and a few other countries.

There are also some so far unverified scientific works that suggest TBC vaccination helping against the disease, so eastern block countries (Since the local bot really seems to hate the S word), where mandatory TBC vaccination was going since 1950s could have an advantage there if this proves to be true.

Also mandatory mask wearing helps a lot.

Has anyone applied to SNAP recently and have received your benefits? It's been 3 weeks since I applied and did the phone interview, nothing yet and I'm getting desperate. My local food bank is already being stretched thin, stimulus website keeps crashing when I try to enter my direct deposit info, and my state's unemployment website is telling independent contractors like me to not apply right now. All these supposed safety nets and none of them are working. :/

As an immunology phD (final year), it's soo frustrating to read comments by journalists and non experts on HCQ.

Anyone with even a couple of years of background in medicine or medical research or pharmacology would tell you that the drug obviously will not do shit after the virus has already caused great lung and organ damage. And this is basically what we have observed so far.

However, the drug may be able to help in the early stages of the disease to try and PREVENT someone from going into the more dangerous phase of the disease.

It's not as black and white as some idiots with no knowledge are making it out to be.

His companies own an interest in a maker of the stuff. It could be as deadly as rat poison and completely ineffective and he still won't care. He pushes it as cover for ordering the government to acquire enough of the stuff to kill every American several times over. He also doesn't care if anyone ever takes the stuff as long as he gets paid.

Two things I'd like to point out, after hearing and reading the opinions of many people in the news, not just ordinary people but radio hosts, politicians and even governors:

Those people who are refraining to "go out" are doing so NOT because they're "afraid" of getting sick or die, or because they're in "panic". Those who are refraining to go out are doing so out of SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY because ANYONE IS A POTENTIAL ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER/SPREADER even if they don't have any symptoms. The idea is "to spread COVID as little as we can" so things can get back to normal as soon as possible.

Those advocating for an early easing of lockouts arguing that the lockouts are "hurting the economy" seem to miss the point that having a sizable portion of the population sick and incapable of working would hurt the economy EVEN MORE. This is already happening as we hear reports of food processing plants and other factories closing down or limiting their output as a big proportion of their workforce is falling victim to COVID-19. This is not about "choosing health OR the economy". The economy is getting hammered no matter what, either because of the lockout of because people are getting sick left and right. The sooner we minimize the spread of COVID-19, the BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY.

How will this end?

I feel reasonably safe, hidden away from other people, but I don't see how it will end. As far as I can tell the choices will be:

A vaccine is developed. However, this might take years before it is actually available to me, due to the time constraints involved in inventing it, testing it, producing it, and distributing it.

Around 90% of the population catch covid, and as a result either die or develop immunity. The virus can't reproduce any more, because it can't find new hosts.

I eventually catch it, and have a high chance of getting really ill or dying.

The other option is to develop more quick and efficient testing with immediate results so that we can isolate people as soon as they contract it and thusly reduce spread.

We can also develop antigen tests to confirm who has had it previously and thusly allow them to go about normal life again. But this is subject to the proviso that immunity can be developed and that the virus cannot cause second infections- which is a debate amongst scientists as it is a novel virus and it can maybe even mutate

If you do catch it, you don't have a high chance of getting really ill or dying. Even for 80+ years old, the case fatality rate is only 15% - it is likely much lower due to unreported infections. If you're under 40, the case fatality rate is 0.2%, and again the real infection fatality rate is likely much lower.

If you're at risk, it's probably the best plan to always be more cautious than the government suggests. Lockdown is likely going to ease gradually, but the virus won't go away. I'm not saying you need to go full hermit until there's a vaccine, but you should do what you need to in order to stay safe.

You stay locked down until there’s a vaccine. Or at least until the infection rate in your area is close to zero, but in that case it would still make sense to avoid exposure.

Context:

Due to corona, the Indian handicraft industry has taken a hit.

I am assisting one of my friends in making a website where we consolidate all the information, potentially link to charities, and have a place to accept donations.

If we can make something like this- https://masks4humanity.org/ , it would be awesome.

Questions:

What free resources can i use to make this website?

Besides linking to existing charities, For donation accepting, what can i do?

Where do i host the website - free would be awesome.

Place where i can buy the domain name - Free would be good.

thanks,

I've been arguing with everyone I know who keep trying to make political arguments about why one place is worse off than another. I keep telling them ultimately it all just comes down to population density and any political arguments are mostly just spurious correlations based on who happens to be governing in X place of high population density.

Absolutely! I’ve never had allergies until I recently moved into a new state. I’ve been playing this game with myself that I either have it or I don’t and it’s nothing.

I imagine there are a ton of people denying their symptoms saying it’s just seasonal allergies.

There is no credible evidence of that. I don't understand why people want to believe that instead of the simplest explanation, that it came from one of the unregulated wet markets of wild animals, in which case it would still be China's fault. It's almost like they WANT it to be a man-made thing, because the fact it came from nature scares them more, as that's harder to predict or control.

Very useful to arrange to give blood, whatever the outcome. Blood banks are screening for covid19. They are giving the data (not personalised) of how many infected donors they get versus non infected donors. This is highly valuable data right now.

They may even keep infected blood for future covid 19 patients. There is preliminary evidence for donors’ blood from people who were previously infected being helpful for presently infected patients.

Whether negative or positive, your blood data will be very useful.

How are new people still getting infected in countries that have been in lockdown for over a month? Since the incubation period is maximum of 14 days shouldn't everyone who got the virus already been detected long ago? And because of the lockdown not many new people should be getting infected so how are there still new cases in those countries?

Because even though we’re in lockdown, people are still aloud out to go food shopping, and key workers who work in those shops or vital things like power plants / telecom companies etc.

All it takes is one person to cough in a supermarket and pretty much anyone who takes things from that aisle home with them could be infecting their family.

Yes, but countries are not trying to completely remove the virus. Lockdowns, and shelter in place were enforced to slow the spread down to keep health care facilities running at a manageable level. Containment in Europe and US had a super short window that no one was able to really do. The whole thing now is mitigation. It’s here and it’s staying here so we make guidelines fit appropriate to what our systems can handle.

I think people don't understand how serious this is, and how long it's going to take. People actually think we've reached the peak, that it's all downhill from here and it would be laughable if it wasn't so scary.

I also think people don't understand how serious our economic situation is going to be and how close we could come to absolute collapse of western society.

And my personal opinion is that once people figure these things out, they will rebel en masse.

One thing I keep thinking about is if US hit the peak, or if it hit the peak of testing capacity. With average ratio of positive test results being some 5% globally, and with 30 000 new cases per day, that is 600 000 tests per day. Unless the testing capacity can be increases far beyond that, how could they get more positive results, unless they start being more picky about who they test?

No one can blame Beijing for a viral outbreak beyond its control. But the Chinese communist regime should be blamed — and held legally liable — for intentionally lying to the world about the danger of the virus, and proactively impeding a global response that might have prevented a worldwide contagion.



We now know that the first case of covid-19 appeared in China’s Hubei province on Nov. 17. By mid-December, Chinese officials knew that the virus was capable of human-to-human transmission because doctors and nurses were getting sick. But instead of alerting the world, they tried to cover it up and punished doctors who tried to sound the alarm. On Jan. 14, the World Health Organization tweeted that “Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” On Jan. 15, the head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention declared on state television that “the risk of human-to-human transmission is low.” These were lies, and Beijing knew it. More than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected.



As China lied, it intentionally hampered U.S. efforts to prepare for the virus’s arrival on our shores by refusing to share samples with us. U.S. officials became so frustrated that they tried a back channel — asking the director of the biocontainment lab at the University of Texas, which had a research partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to see whether he could get samples. The Post reports that “At first, the lab in Wuhan agreed, but officials in Beijing intervened Jan. 24 and blocked any lab-to-lab transfer.” That intervention came one day after Beijing finally imposed a belated lockdown on Wuhan — which means even after Chinese officials finally publicly acknowledged they were battling a pandemic they were still obstructing the U.S. response.



It took Beijing more than two months after the first case appeared to impose that lockdown. That coverup had deadly consequences. A University of Southampton study found that if Beijing acted just three weeks sooner, the number of covid-19 cases might have been reduced by 95 percent — which would have prevented a pandemic.



And China’s lies and obstruction are ongoing. The U.S. intelligence community has reportedly concluded that Beijing is underreporting both total cases and deaths it has suffered from covid-19 — denying U.S. scientists accurate data they need to understand how the virus behaves. This is more than mere negligence; it is active disinformation and obstruction.



Why are Chinese officials so determined to cover up the outbreak? Perhaps because, as David Ignatius recently reported, the virus might not have originated organically in Wuhan’s wet market. It might have begun instead as an accidental lab release of bat coronavirus from the Wuhan branch of China’s CDC less than 300 yards from the market — perhaps through the infection of a lab worker, a leaked sample or poor hazardous waste disposal. If so, that would add an additional layer to China’s culpability.

World Health Regulations 2005 were established explicitly to avoid this situation after SARS. They state a country MUST notify WHO and foreign health authorities of a potential pandemic emerging. China did the opposite. China lied and covered up Wuhan epidemic/ potential pandemic in the early weeks. Take CCP to the International Court and get reparations.

China never stopped any country from preparing. USA f***ed it up. Actually Trump f***ed it up or worse deliberately delayed organising. Trump was given the intelligence. Even if he didn't Jan 23 the world found out that China quarantined 50 million people. If more people died in China, that is their problem. Blind Freddy knew it was something serious because of the size and scope of the quarantine. Any redditor could tell you it was serious.
You need to be asking why Trump didn't respond in an orderly fashion.

No but they did obfuscate the facts and pressured WHO not to admit that the virus could be spread from human to human. This caused weeks of delay. They also tried to downplay the virus and limit access to research on the virus. This isn't in any way, shape or form to exonerate Trump but the Chinese government has a lot to answer for. From its own people and the world.

I think it's just a natural backlash against some of the extreme negativity for a while. Now that the most extreme predictions (Bodies in the streets in two weeks, millions dead in the US, etc) are wrong clearly, the people who maybe stressed out or were annoyed by that kind of talk are responding (maybe a bit overzealously). It can be annoying but it'll fade

Herein, we report that the FDA-approved gold drug, auranofin, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in human cells at low micro molar concentration. Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 hours after infection. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its anti-viral, anti- inflammatory and anti-ROS properties. Auranofin has a well-known toxicity profile and is considered safe for human use.

If an investigation does turn out that a lab accidentally released this virus, and a country tried to covered it up while banning domestic travel to their city of spread but allowing international travel. How do you think that would change the way things move forward throughout the world?

In no way at all.

There will be 20 different versions of origin of the virus, each side will have research papers backing them up and governments of various countries will just do the usual propaganda, supporting whatever suits their current geo-political agenda.

Well hopefully we won’t get up to 34k again. I expect fatalities to increase due to CDC now including presumptive cases that no longer requires testing. Maybe by this method we can actually get a clearer understanding of the disease impact.

I'd wait until the numbers finish coming in today. A lot of people were predicting a spike in confirmed cases yesterday, yet they were lower than the previous week. Today does look like it'll be higher than yesterday, but it's slightly too early to make that claim. Either way, this week will definitely be a brutal one.

That would mean the curve is mostly flat, that's good news considering the scenario people were warning about was exponential growth. In countries that are ahead of us in the curve we've seen it remains flat a long time before it actually starts coming down.

Slowing down, doesn’t mean that deaths immediately go down. Deaths have been around 2k for the last 7 days. If it was growing at the old rate, we were doubling every seven days. The fact that we haven’t hit 4K deaths means we’re slowing down.

My gf has her period and she has extremely clotted blood down there (way more than usual). She's not showing any symptoms of covid though. I did some quick research and found no direct correlation between menstruation and covid-19. My bet is that it's caused by a very high level of stress, which makes sense with the current global situation.

So clearly corona is gonna be around awhile.

What is everyone’s plan when unemployment runs out and there’s no jobs to go back to? Cause who’s gonna have $ to buy a car, build a house, or buy a boat? No demand = no jobs.

Or what’s the plan when the $600 extra runs out in 4 months?

Is anyone else as nervous as myself?

Unemployment insurance is good for 39 weeks. No one needs to worry about jobs for a bit if you we're making roughly 50-60k one could argue you're better off to just collect unemployment and do some side gigs and spend time with family.

Unemployment doesn’t pay near as much as what I make in my state. Not enough to pay my bills. The extra $600 gets me close but that’s only good for 4 months.

I’d guess at least 5 million of the current 17 million will still be laid off in 6 months.

Massive peaceful “in-car” protests happening in Michigan right now in the capital. Respect the hell out of it. Mostly small business owners ranging from home contractors to landscape architecture. My aunt and uncle are there. Whitmer has shut down small businesses and not even given them a seat at the table to talk reason. Their company proposed one person per vehicle, not even running at full capacity. Just one worker doing jobs that need to be done right now at this point in the season, that impact the entire landscape business for the whole season. But there’s no grey areas. They live in SW Michigan, rural and not impacted nearly as bad as big cities in MI, the entire area is small business and these decisions are going to shut down many of these businesses for good

Um. In car peaceful protests? If you turn on any news channels or social media live stream you will see hundreds on people on and around the Capitol, taking absolutely no precautions, not wearing masks, standing right next to each other. Entire families and people very clearly in at-risk populations. Not to mentions those “peaceful” cars that are currently blocking ambulances and health care staff trying to get to Sparrow, Lansing’s main hospital that’s a few blocks away. Sounds super peaceful to me.

its not really a massive undertaking if the feds so ordered it.

probably I suspect they are dancing around patents and trademarks and contracts so as not to ruin the profitability for 3M and others Notice i have never heard 3M or anyone say the will sell masks as cost or license to anyone.

The history of this pandemic will also be a pandemic of profiteering and greed and corruption. The stimulus pkg cuts taxes for the 1%. Yes your read it correctly, they got their taxes cut again in the CV bailout bill.

I received more than $1,200 from my stimulus direct deposit this morning - nothing significant, but a few hundred dollars extra. Oddly, the amount was not an even numeric value. I have no dependents, I am not receiving any form of unemployment or government benefits. Any idea why this would be? I don't know whether I should report it.

I received an odd amount as well, but several hundred less than what we were expecting. It's not a round dollar amount; almost like something was deducted. We did not hit the income cap. We do pay child support, but we checked to ensure we were not in arrears (my husband is furloughed so we were worried about that).

I'm just really confused about the odd dollar amount.

Personally, I think as long as the two of you know that you aren’t seeing others, you’re not a bad person.

But if someone goes to see a friend, who then sees another friend and so on, that’s where there’s a dangerous slippery slope we should avoid.

I see a lot of cases not being reported in less developed countries. For instance, seeing India below Austria makes no sense. We all understand it's more than that.

Well, I'm not here for a discussion but wonder if anyone knows of any good articles concerning this. Are there estimates for the countries who are not reporting at all or reporting low numbers?

No idea. That's why I'm interested in reading about it from people who knows more about it than me.

It doesn't have to be specifically about estimates. It could be about the unrecorded cases in general.

I don't have an agenda in this at all, I'm just curious about it.

I could see some ways of trying to get a super rough ballpark

Maybe something like looking at spikes in flulike symptoms in general compared to some baseline

Or look at how many people died in an area compared to that area's average and use some estimate of the IFR to deduce how many cases would have been needed to make that happen?

Also not an expert, don't know if they'd work, just the first things I thought of

I don't understand how people envision the filter media having some effect in one direction but zero effect in the other direction like how would that even work

Yes, of course n95s are better but be careful of black-and-white thinking. I want spf 75 to cross the desert but I'd take spf 10 tanning lotion if that's all there was

That being the case, I'd still try to as hard as I could to avoid even going anywhere that made the mask worth it (but if absolutely forced we do what we can)

Even then, N95s require proper fitting techniques to be safe enough. Healthcare workers take a certification test every 2 years on how to properly wear it. You need to be cleanly shaven too. It has to be on there perfectly to protect you and even that is not a guarantee.

Best bet is to stay in as much as you can, keep your distance from others, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face. Do this properly and 99% chance you will not get the virus.

AFAIK, the virus particles can pass through an N95 mask also. As the other guy pointed out, if it's not fitted properly, it's practically a surgical mask at that point.

Does anyone know how what percentage of patients who died to corona also had other underlying health problems like obesity?

Also how dangerous is this virus? As always when I do my own research I’m always skeptical of certain things being exaggerated and when I research I always find articles that contradict each other. Some are saying the virus is exaggerated and less lethal than the flu and some say the opposite. I assume it’s somewhere in the middle but I have no idea what sources to trust. I don’t want to be someone that reads one article and then bases my whole beliefs off it.

My father is trying to convince me that the whole virus is not dangerous at all and everyone is over reacting. He tells me that only those that are elderly with other conditions die in statistically significant quantities.

I accept that I am ignorant and I’m hoping that someone hear can educate me on how much of a threat this virus is. I also keep in mind that not everything is know about the virus yet. Thanks in advance.

No, in fact quite the opposite. Runny nose isn’t usually a symptom. Cough, difficulty breathing, fever are common. Maybe a lost sense of smell.

Also this is like the 4th question I’ve posted in this thread lol but I go to boarding school in a major east coast metro area. In early February, before there was known community spread (I think there were maybe 1-2 confirmed cases in the city related to travel), a classmate of mine had a HORRIBLE dry cough and fever that lasted 2-3 weeks and spread to the rest of us as well with varying degrees of severity. None of us needed medical attention just OTC meds but that’s not surprising considering we are 16-18 and for the most part healthy. What are the odds y’all think that was covid?

The undeveloped world won’t get it for years. It’ll start with high risk people. Then healthcare workers and first responders. Then probably corporations will try to give it to their staffs. Eventually you’ll be able tog et it at a doctor or a pharmacy.

I knew this was bad when the UK closed all schools in March and cancelled exams, the extremely important A-Level and GCSEs, which usually take place in June, almost 3 months away.

However I didn’t know it was this f***ing bad

I have only realised recently that there is no exit strategy; the elusive vaccine.

149 deaths so far. Let's try to keep that pace much less than yesterday's total. Cause that was not good.

Corona-virus spreads by mouth or not; Who to believe ?

WHO says `People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. `

The CDC, the USDA, and medical experts say "There is no evidence of the corona-virus being spread via food."

If it does spread by mouth, then how come it doesn't spread by eating a pizza pie coughed on by a person who has corona virus?

They say you should wash your hands after touching the pizza box because virus can spread when you touch your mouth, but they also say you can eat the pizza that has virus on it!

?!?

They’re saying there’s no evidence the food you buy from the store will have virus from the farm or packaging plant. But if the pizza delivery guy hacks a lugey on your Donatos box, you could be in trouble.

Thank you!! This is bothering me as well. There are articles with doctors specifically saying that “there is no evidence you can get coronavirus from take-out food,” but the same scientists are saying that you can get it by touching a surface and touching your face? Makes no sense.

You can get it that way, but you are much more likely to get it other ways.

That's why they say that.

It's pragmatism. It's also effective science communication so people don't start freaking out and get sick from malnutrition that's compromising their immune system.

Seriously, make sure you eat healthy so your body is ready if and when you do get infected.

I appreciate hearing it from someone who studies virology! I would personally so much rather hear the truth though.

Can you shed any light on the chances of catching it from the air vs. from an infected surface? My intuition tells me you’re much, much more likely to catch it from the air, but I don’t have any evidence to back that up. Maybe there have been studies done on other respiratory viruses?

Does not mean "We believe coronavirus can't be spread via food."

It means "We have not found a case where it can be proven the person was infected this way."

The oven is going to kill anything on the pizza so your chance of exposure is going to come from the one person who takes it out of the oven and boxes it. In terms of relative risk I think the chances of getting it is probably lower via eating pizza if you ate it everyday for a month than if you licked a store's credit card reader's buttons one time.

It likely could spread by eating a pizza slice someone coughed on.

But that would be a "fomite" (physical object that's a vector for transmission) just like the counter or the doorknob that you touch and then touch your face. This is also why it's so important to wash your hands before you eat.

The cooking process itself at any health-department inspected restaurant is hot enough to kill CoV many times over.

All restaurant employees should also be wearing face coverings at this point, and if they're not, then I wouldn't take out food from that restaurant.

I know it's hard to know if you're ordering online, and I apologize for that. There's an element of prudence to these things. For the most part, there shouldn't be enough virus to infect you on hot, ready made food, that's packaged well.

Maybe they mean that cooking the food kills off any virus that the food had prior? Not that someone coughing on food is okay.

They're saying that by inhaling the coronavirus it can infect you, but if you eat it and ingest it, your stomach will kill it since it's highly acidic. If you touch your mouth and breathe with corona on your mouth the whole time, there is the possibility that you inhale it and become infected. Your eyes and nose provide a pathway for coronavirus to enter your body and work it's way to the lungs. Plus, more people have touched the pizza box than the pizza, and I'd the pizza is cooked sufficiently, any traces of corona that were on it should die

I'm aware that corona-virus can only infect by specific tissues with ACE2 receptors and it becomes disintegrated in stomach. What I say is, if a cook sneezed over your pizza AFTER it's cooked and placed in a box, the corona-virus droplets will make it to your mouth and throat. People can breath through mouth too. Some droplets emerging from the food inside your mouth can land on your pharynx too. What experts say is there is no evidence of that. Meanwhile, that does not mean it won't or doesn't happen. So I wonder how they say it's safe to eat a covid-19 flavored pizza?

Probably not very safe if they sneeze directly onto your food. That being said, the chances of that may be slim. Maybe swallowing the food with saliva helps wash the virus out of your esophagus/upper respiratory tract before the epiglottis? This isn't proven or anything I'm just trying to brainstorm a mechanism for why that could happen

Received stimulus check today. I have a SSN since I worked here as an exchange student but my visa expired 2 years ago and I have been working somewhere else using that SSN just my employer didn’t ask for an I-9. Obviously I am grateful I received it. But does this mean I can also apply for unemployment? Surely if I don’t want them to find out about my status, I‘d rather not file at all right? Lol

Genuine question - Why do survivors of covid-19 not develop immunity to it? I could see why that would be the case if it were rapidly evolving but that doesn't seem to be the case so far. Further, wouldn't survivors have antibodies that can be used to build a vaccine?

My best take on it so far it is that it's not that survivors bodies are fighting off the virus, rather it's just that they had a "smaller" infection by volume and their bodies were able to survive despite the impact. If that's the case, how does the infection disappear from the body? What prevents the infection from multiplying?

Firstly, who said they don’t develop immunity? Most do. How long for? Not sure. But they do develop immunity.

Secondly, they do have some antibodies as well to protect them hence why we are testing ppl for antibodies to see if they can go back out in society and/or donate blood plasma.

Idk what you’re asking to explain bc I’m not sure where you get the info that survivors DON’T develop antibodies and immunity when most research says they do (we do not have data on how long that is for though).

I mean, I realize I'm out of the Reddit loop a little bit maybe, but honestly, I still am under the impression that most likely, survivors do develop immunity. Exactly what you said; the virus isn't rapidly evolving. If a person's body has successfully fought it off, they have antibodies that should protect them from getting it again before it has evolved significantly. Perhaps there are some false negative or false positive tests that are resulting in research results on the subject being unclear? I think it's just that time is needed, for proper studies and research to be done. People are so interested in the results, that everything is getting reported before we're really totally sure of anything.

Edit: Nevermind, my bank deposited to my current account! They told me they werent because it has been over 90 days, but for some reason they went ahead and transferred it!

You can't be allowed to see someone's test results. Same as you cannot call up the local hospitals wanting info on people due to HIPPA laws.

As someone in the same boat as you with being "essential", I'd wear gloves, mask, wash hands, verbally ridicule this person to stay away, and keep at my job earning money while I can.

The social distancing and other measures taken are showing effect in most countries. The strain on ICUs is slowly decreasing but will take weeks to get back to normal levels. This is all because of the measures taken, and thus we should not loosen up anything just yet. And after that, a balance needs to be carefully found

But there’s already a problem. Even people who don’t know what the hell they’re doing think they’re doing a good job. I grabbed a burger bag at the drive through window. Did I touch my eye before I made it home to wash my hands? I don’t honestly remember.

The reason they give guidelines is to decrease the likelihood of infection. But unless you have no contact with other people, the likelihood is never zero.

Here’s the simplest model I’ve seen. You can’t really do it after the fact for an individual because there are too many variables that would all have to be controlled for. But you can do it on populations. They call that R0. The lower, the better your population has done.

I was thinking with the amount and diversity of users on Reddit there has to be someone, or someone that knows someone, that thinks they caught it after they began complying with all the preventative measures recommended. In my community (it's a small county, 17k people), 80% of the cases have been from a single senior care home (one lady traveled to another city for a bridge tournament mid March and they think that's source) and the other known cases are from folks that either traveled or were exposed to spring break tourists. From what I can tell, there hasn't been any new cases since we started practicing awareness of COVID19 and I'm just curious if other communities are similar.

Obviously not looking to quantify diligence. If someone (or someone knows someone) who qualifies as diligent in response to coronavirus and still caught it, I'd like to know. Like, I'd say I personally qualify as being super diligent and curious if anyone like myself has caught the virus.

Probably somebody has. But the odds are much lower than if you went to Mardi Gras.

And you have to quantitate diligence somehow because that’s the threshold you set to determine if the person was sufficiently diligent or not.

Can't find any this second but it would be good to find studies that show infection rates among healthcare workers who have the proper ppe vs those who were unaware at the beginning of the outbreak and weren't using ppe and were just following normal hospital hand sanitizing protocols. That data would be more significant because healthcare workers have much more exposure to infection.

Other problem is the incubation period varies quite a bit.

If you're in a state that only imposed social isolation or shutting down businesses near the end of march, you could have been living a normal life right up until April 1st!

And the incubation period is likely up to around 14 days. So you'd be starting to develop symptoms right about now...

Sure, agreed. I'm specifically interested in folks that complied with experts' advice upon shelter in place orders that have contracted the virus since then.

There's got to be people out there that believe they were taking every precaution to a reasonable degree since the shut down yet still contracted the virus, right? If not, that's good news I'd say...

I live in CO a friend has their unemployment marked as paid back on 4/5 and three times since then. However, no funds have been deposited via direct deposit. There was a form that may have needed to be signed I’m hearing, but she didn’t sign this and the claim was approved. I don’t see any forms available on the current UI page and no one can get through to the Unemployment office. Any advice?

Depends on the state, will do better on a Colorado subreddit. In Indiana there isn't direct deposit, it's a debit card you can get cash from. I never knew anyone on it when I lived out in Colorado, sorry.

Because the government made that decision to exclude to keep the total bill of the stimulus lower. I’d imagine their reasoning is, people who are claimed as dependent, are supposed to have their shelter/home provided for them. Since they aren’t paying rent, they are much more equipped to weather the storm. Now if you are being claimed as a dependent and aren’t given shelter, then your parents or whomever is claiming you is committing tax fraud.

any idea what might happen to a stimulus check sent to the wrong account? our cpa filed our taxes 5 weeks ago, and they've been delayed due the stimulus stuff taking priority. we asked him if our new bank account info was processed and he assured us that yes, it was. spoiler alert: it was not. i can track the stimulus payment and it says it was deposited to the old account. old bank says the account doesn't exist and it will bounce. and then??? paper check? into the abyss?

Your CPA needs to fix this.

If they don't you might want to speak to a lawyer. Or ask the question in r/legaladvice

Just some vague data on that, but the studies making the headlines say it can be in your system for 37 days.

Might want to check for sure at r/stimuluscheck

At the moment there isn’t any way to update on the IRS webpage so you would get that extra $500 when you file next year.

If you haven't filed your 2019 taxes yet, it is based on your 2018 tax return.

However, as I understand it, it's a below-the-line tax credit. So when you file your taxes for 2020, you'll receive the additional $500 tax credit.

We filed/claimed him on our 2018 taxes that were done in spring of 2019, and we also filed him on our 2019 taxes that we did about a month ago - like March 20th of this year. So, I don’t know what happened.

Stimulus check question, haven't been able to find an answer anywhere. I filed as a dependant for my 2018 returns but my 2019 returns will not be a dependant. I haven't filed 2019. If I file now will I get my check? Any resource I can look into for this?

you can read it all on the IRS stimulus page. they base literally everything on this year's taxes if you have it. if you haven't, then they use the previous year. so i guess theorietically if your former guardian didn't file for you this year then you shouldnt' have a problem once you file, but people filing late will get their check late.

It's roughly the way it's worked out in other locations, but the big variable is how long the plateau at the top is. And while this is our first experience with this disease, it's not the first pandemic/epidemic from which we can garner data.

There's a lot of assumptions that go into these models. Let's start with some fairly common knowledge: The tested population isn't the only infected population. There are a great many told to recover at home who never received a test and recovered just fine. Then there are those people (as many as 50%, according to Dr. Fauci) who will contract the virus and never show a single symptom. All this means some base level of immunity building in the population. This isn't enough to impart herd immunity yet, but these individuals do act as control rods to slow the future spread.

Also, while social distancing deserves some of the credit, the fact is that this virus has not lived up to the danger of even the most optimistic models earlier on.

This leads to two things: The virus is both more widespread, and less lethal, than originally anticipated. With social distancing measures in place, we climb down the back side of the slope at about the same rate as the front.

We will need to continue some kind of the measures, but we can't let ourselves move the goalposts here. The idea was to flatten the curve, something we've been actually fairly successful with. We can't adopt a mentality of zero new infections, it's very unrealistic and economic pressure combined with social pressure will make that ineffective in the long term anyway.

They literally take the Wuhan curve and scale it to whatever place they think they're starting at. In Wuhan they were welding people into their homes, arresting every thing that moved. We are not going to see the type of precipitous e they saw because our lockdowns are Far more lenient and voluntary. But they didn't have an example of that to scale their forecast to.

It's a sharpie forecast. They cleaned it up some to make it look more diligent but it's essentially worthless. Except as an example of how not to make a forecast.

Right now it appears to be largely anecdotal. I will say my father got what we are pretty sure was Covid after a cruise and was quite sick. My mother who was on the cruise with him, myself and my girlfriend (who picked them up from the cruise and were in close proximity with both the entire week before he got sick and when he slowly started recovering) did not.

My father is blood type A, my mom and I are O, my girlfriend is probably B.

Similar account here. We live in NJ-our babysitter (unknown blood type) had a fluctuating fever the first week of March, which developed into a cough for about 7 days. She showed up to our house one morning not feeling well to babysit. We decided to take her temperature which turned out to be 102. We paid her for the day and immediately sent her home. The next day our one year old ran a temperature of 102 and developed a cough that lasted roughly five days. My wife (O Negative) myself (O Neg) and our five year old suffered minor symptoms. I only had mild fatigue and vertigo for several days (unknown if vertigo is related to COVID) my wife suffered a horrendous dry cough, waking up one night having difficulty breathing but no fever. Our five year old had only a cough at night. My one year old literally sneezed in my face, and I did not develop a fever, cough, etc.

Our state wasn’t on lockdown during this time, and the reported cases throughout the state were relatively low, so we assumed it was the flu or a viral infection.

Three weeks after my babysitter showed symptoms, she tested positive for covid19, as well as her father and sister, who are both RN’s. My family was never tested. When my babysitter was tested, she no longer felt ill.

Hey another O- out there! Has the Red Cross emailed you 40 times yet to donate blood during this pandemic because I’ve gotten atleast that many haha, though I signed up to donate next week

About the same timing here. My mom and girlfriend had no symptoms, I may have but my yearly sinus issues I get around that time every year hit so I don’t know.

Just waiting to get an antibody test now

My fellow O’er-We are a rare blood line, resistant to various viruses/diseases but god forbid we need a blood transfusion.

I have yet to receive any correspondence from the Red Cross, as I have yet to sign up for any blood donations (yet). But shame on me for not doing so.

I’m very interested in an antibody test. It puts me at ease knowing that I was off from work the first couple weeks of March, as we moved into our new home. If I was an asymptomatic carrier, I’m glad that I wasn’t around anyone aside from my immediate family. Same with my wife and children.

Glad it worked out well from your family. It will be interesting to see the number of Blood Type O that result in positive antibody tests that did not show symptoms. That’s why social distancing and being in quarantine is so important for the sake of humanity.

Rental car companies are capitalising on the pandemic, preying on those that still require their services. $200 deposit skyrocketed to $1000. No shame I guess. Just an FYI. Enjoy your day and stay safe.

They retroactively add old stuff to the day the person died or got infected, so no. Probably the result of everyone going to see that ship on March 30 just now becoming sick enough to require medical.

I read that cv particles can stay viable on masks for 7 days. If you must reuse before 7 days, either spray with hydrogen peroxide and let dry or sterilize. See video :

The cdc has posted methods of sterilizing masks on their website and you can find some additional studies on pubmed.

I think the virus lasts on masks for 24-48 hours depending on moisture and material. Best to keep the mask in a brown paper bag so it can breath.

I can’t remember this type of lock down within the last 40 years. I was shocked to know in January China locked down a city all of a sudden and quarantine the entire country during their new year. I don’t remember they did this for SARS back in 2002-03. It must be bad I thought, but then I was told by my country that it’s just a flu... and the rest is history...

When does worldometers cap off the end of a day for case and death counts? Sometimes I'm checking it at ~7pm and it's already rolled over to a new day even though the death counter is still going up for the current day. What timezone do they use to go to a new day?

I can't find any links/articles about the amount of hand washing you should do.

So, if I get home from the grocery store, is one thorough hand wash enough? Can I now touch my face or eat something with my hands? If not, what's the proper amount and situation to wash your hands?

Yes. The virus particle is composed of a thin lipid (fat) wall with the virus code inside. Soap + scrubbing destroys the wall and water washes away the code.

:) Sorry! I thought it was a relevant place to share it.

The final number of people who think they have had it or not might be fairly close to the real figure. Its a cheap and quick way to paint a realistic picture. More information can be found here

No, it's not safe at all. Some people just don't understand that stay home means STAY HOME. The friends ' houses your son would be visiting might have an asymptomatic carrier of the virus.

What is our strategy?

Containment/stopping the spread (contact tracing, long shutdown periods, "the new normal")

Mitigation/herd immunity (control spread, not overwhelming hospitals, most people get virus)

It is important that everyone is clear.

If the coronavirus death rate is so low, why is the number of deaths divided by number of recoveries so scary?

For example, it doesn't seem possible that the virus has a 4% deathrate when 28k people have died and only 48k recovered.

I don't trust China's numbers generally, but even more encouraging numbers like Germany are still 3800/72000 and that's still a 6% death rate.

Am I missing something? Is this the mortality rate I'm calculating? If so, what's the difference? Because my work isn't closing and it's scary to remind myself that this exists.

Recovery numbers are artificially deflated, because testing is mostly focused on identifying new cases and rarely on proving recovery.

You have to keep in mind the tons of people who had the virus and never even knew it. They aren't testing nearly enough in most places to have an idea of an accurate death rate, but surely it's much lower than those percentages.

They’re only counting official recovery as those who have retested negative twice. At least in Philly, (as of when I called the health department this morning) they are not doing retesting. I imagine that’s most places across the US. So you have a whole population of patients that are miscounted, plus all the patients that never knew they had it.

I’m pretty sure those numbers are artificial for now because most confirmed cases are still ongoing.

Also in America, only about 1 in 10 cases are confirmed. And I don’t know for sure, but I’m pretty sure that they report most coronavirus deaths. So the number of deaths compared to confirmed cases might seem closer than they actually are.

The numbers are pointless until we have a finite limit, ie everyone is tested. If we dont know the total, the percentages and numbers mean nothing. What about those self isolating at home ?

since antibody tests cant be rolled out on a world wide level and some countries are not to be trusted with their numbers i think the closest realistic figure we can get is by taking a

did anyone see an article today claiming that a hospital was reducing nurses' pay by 15% due to a lack of elective surgeries? I think I saw it on Hot this morning, but I can't find it now. I'm wondering if it was removed from being innaccurate or from something more insidious. Google was no help either

I've tried searching this before positing but despite finding some good old posts I still don't feel like I 100% understand ...when we talk about 'past the peak' what measure is that by? The number of new cases, the number of deaths, the number of active cases or a mix of all three?

bascially the number of infections fall, which means exponentional growth is slowling due to social distancing and better testing

so over time the cases will decrease and strain on health care will drop,

yes, but you have to assume countries would have better contact tracing and be more aware of the virus when lockdwons are relaxed

But in many places the number of infection is not know because it rises as the pcr testing rises. So looking at hospital bed capacity, then ICU capacity, and deaths is the best way. By extrapolating the time lag you can get a Polaroid of what happened 2-3 weeks ago on the infection front.

It’s the rate at which the number of new cases is increasing, the slope of the line. If we have 5 days of new cases of 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, the slope is flat as the number of new cases is staying steady. If we have five days of 2,4,6,8,10 then the slope is going up- towards what we hope would be a peak that would level off and then come down. If we have 5 days of 5,4,3,2,1 the slope is going down. We are still getting new cases but fewer and fewer each day. That’s the scenario where we would be past the peak.

On the IRS site it says this: "Taxpayers likely won't qualify for an Economic Impact Payment if any of the following apply: You can be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return. For example, this would include a child, student or older dependent who can be claimed on a parent’s return."

That's conveniently vague. Any insights?

If yoy haven't filed go to the IRS website and click on non filers enter payment info here.

If you filed and claimed yourself you should be set.

Yes, if no one claimed you, you will get the stimulus, as long as you didn't make oner the specified amount.

Hey y’all. I know that people may be asymptomatic for up to 14 days, and am aware of more recent data that shows people may be asymptomatic the whole time that they are carriers. However I was wondering what seems to be the common carrying period before showing symptoms if they are to show symptoms at all. Thanks

5 days is the medium, half of people will show symptoms before then and half will show later. Mostly between 1-14 days, symptoms onset on day 0 or after 15 would be considered outliers.

Reputation. And I know people that worked on it. Also got emergency approval, but they waited until they did internal testing so they didn't release it into the wild without efficacy. Probably won't become gold standard due to in house manufacture scaling, but it is one I trust not being a virologist.

I keep hearing an estimation of 35 million deaths. I am unsure if that's with or with quarantine. Either way, deaths aren't as big of an issue when you consider that even if you survived this, there is a chance of permanent lung scarring and organ damage.

Ok, so I made a mask using the HKMask from Dr. Kwong. But I don't really understand how I get my hands on the filter. He uses tissues or kitchen paper to get to the 95% but that makes breathing rather difficult. Does anyone know how to obtain the nanofilter he describes on his website? He claims that you can buy that in any other country.

If it left you with permanently impaired lung function, it's bad. If your pneumonia came about because of an underlying condition that impaired your lung function, it's bad. If you had pneumonia like a day before you contracted covid-19, it's bad. Otherwise it's not so bad.

A Scotland study says the number of people who had antibodies (previous exposure) out number known cases by a factor of 65 to 1. But that study is preliminary and not peer reviewed yet. Other antibody studies done in Europe seems to confirm this. https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g2ec30/3_of_dutch_blood_donors_have_covid19_antibodies/ https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/-/number-of-people-with-coronavirus-infections-may-be-dozens-of-times-higher-than-the-number-of-confirmed-cases

Commenting from texas. As if things couldn’t get worse, my grandmothers restaurant is closing down once all of this is over. that being said can anyone help me with some unemployment questions? The twc released call times by area codes, so i waited for my designated time to call, called 30+ times and could never get through. tried to get online and got booted off and redirected to the (877) number. I’ve stayed up all hours of the night hoping to get into her application(for low volume purposes) and still it’s hopeless. do i keep trying? is there a local office i can stop by? she was able to get SNAP taken care though so that’s good.

additionally really hope everyone is doing good and staying safe. <3

I'll try to come back here and comment if my girlfriend manages to get through the system somehow. She's had the same issues but if anything changes or we figure out a way to get it to work I'll come back and say.

Good luck.

Sounds like your over thinking, red spots are not a symptom I’ve heard of.

Less than 2 in 100 people tested in Australia actually has this for example. 98 thought they has it.

People will still have colds and flus.

If you can get tested

Here's some proof this subreddit is being astroturfed by companies or governments. This account has posted nothing but generic cat pictures and comments for years, then randomly starts posting nothing but coronavirus stuff

Evidence of astroturfing? I also posted about nothing but my hobbies and now post just in this sub. Lots of other subs have tanked in posting activity since people are distracted by coronavirus, and there's a giant banner at the top of the front page telling people to come here.

Posting generic flickr links of cats for years and every single comment being the exact same tone is not normal.

Not sure if you're just looking at the submissions history but their comment history is a bunch of totally normal comments about cats and cycling.
I'm not saying astroturfing isn't real but I don't find anything particularly suspicious here. A bunch of people suddenly are dropping all their normal Reddit activities to push a particular angle on r/coronavirus since coronavirus has a huge impact on all of us.

I and my family have patiently isolated for the past several weeks. I have left the house twice in the last several weeks, both times to pick up groceries curbside. My patience came from the belief that our government would have something in place to help contain or manage this. They've done f***all from what I can see. We had reports of wide distribution of tests that never showed up, rapid 5 minute tests that seem to be a fable. I have family members who have been furloughed, laid off etc. and it is getting worse.

Our government is incompetent and unwilling to change. We are going to have to go through this the hard way. If you are not immunocompromised or older than 50 or in a vulnerable group, I say restrictions for the rest of us needs to be eased. In other words, I am done. When I go out, I will wear mask and use hand sanitizer. I am willing to be convinced otherwise, willing to endure this if there is a sliver of light at the end of this excruciating tunnel. Otherwise, open shit back up.

Part of the issue too is about how many patients hospitals can handle at a time. The idea of flattening the curve that's floating around is that if suddenly tons of patients come in with covid, the hospitals do not have enough ventilators etc to treat them. Vs if there are measures to slow this down then maybe hospitals can cope better and/or there may be a possibility for some kind of treatment being developed that doesn't exist now

I get that. But what are the age group of those needing to be on a vent? Look at the age distribution. Absolutely lockdown nursing homes, they are the most vulnerable. Then place restrictions on the immunocompromised and other vulnerable groups but let the rest of us go.

I have not been isolating for myself but rather for the protection of my community. But we can't continue months long lockdown.

Check your local foodbank to see how dire the situation is. We can't let this continue.

Sadly there's no specific age groups like that. Source- husband is an ER doctor. Healthy 20 and 30 year olds are ending up on ventilators with no prior history. Less percentage of them sure but no age group is safe except little kids

We can't allow this to continue indefinitely either. I am in the US where healthcare is tied to employment. I have an unprecedented number of family members who have been furloughed/laid off without any benefits. Just added 2 to the number this morning. They qualify for unemployment but what are they going to do for health insurance? Getting sick is going to wipe them out financially. They have family, so they will be ok. but not everyone is fortunate. We can't continue this indefinitely. Not sure what the answer is but the our incompetent government is not going to resolve the issue.

As a 29yo/F (135lbs, vegetarian, healthy) that has been suffering and is on day 26 of having the virus, and for the first time I was able to walk up my stairs and sleep in my own bed (finally) after day 24. This virus can affect anyone at any age under any health condition. Keep others, your family, and yourself safe. Yeah it sucks, I have been quarantined this whole time. All I've seen for nearly a month (can't even leave to the store or even for a walk as I could infect someone) is my apartment, the closed vape shop across the street and the ER a couple time (one of which I was nearly put on a ventilator).

Don't get others sick and make them suffer because your "done". We all are, but we are all in this together. It will get better, with time.

If you and everyone else that thinks this way just suddenly stop isolating, thats a lot of people that are exposing themselves and is allowing it to infect people faster. There’s no saying you won’t get it, you could get severely sick and need medical attention/hospitalization even if you’re not high risk. Staying at home shouldn’t be that hard when you’re doing it for the greater good, and if it is truly that miserable, then make a routine to keep yourself busy. You’re allowed to go on walks. You can sit outside and have a drink in the sun. You can catch up on movies you’ve wanted to see, start that exercise regime you’ve wanted to start for forever, cook that thing you’ve always wanted to try, reread you favorite books, play an old video game that you loved as a child or even start a new one. Besides, if you start going out right now what would you even do? Everything is closed. Can’t go to bars, restaurants, or anything with a crowd anyways because it’s too risky. And there’s no way they can safely lift all restrictions at once because people will die. And not even just from covid, but the hospitals can potentially become so over full with the surge of covid patients that people could die of other things that they wouldn’t have died from with medical intervention, like a heart attack, or whatever else. But now they can’t treat those people because a bunch of people decided f*** this and the beds are full. You’re not under house arrest and you can do some things freely as long as you do it with caution. It can’t all go back to normal right away because it will be potentially devastating.

There's no silver bullet. Being scared of the outdoors isn't helping you. Wear a mask if you're in a crowded space, and wash your hands after touching anything. Just doing that is more than a lot of people are doing and will help you.

Hey everyone. I know that coronavirus affects women less severely than men.

That being said, I am a transgender male-to-female, on hormones of course. From a biological standpoint, can I go off the male or female death rate/severe conditions numbers?

Does anyone else buy the theory that Covid-19 was present in California way back in early January. Anecdotally speaking, my mom and I had the worst flu symptoms in our recent memory in mid January. I work as a cashier at a restaurant and she is a house keeper. We had all the Covid-19 symptoms and I even got the symptoms again in mid February. Of course at that time 98% of Americans assumed it wouldn't spread like it is right now. Anybody else buy into it or just me. Was anyone testing for Covid back in January?

First confirmed case was January 21st, on West Coast.

It is possible it was brought in earlier, however, the incubation period sits on average somewhere around 7 days. For you to be going through sever symptoms in the middle of January, you would have to be infected pretty early. I would say the chances are slim and most likely you just had the good old flu.

Yes that's what I assumed, of course I am 19 and quite healthy, I may have experienced mild symptoms of Covid. In fact, I took an uber on February 19th and my Uber driver claimed he had Covid in the last week of January. I was shocked but i also examined my cases even more carefully. And I'm from San Diego btw, but with all due respect to any Chinese people reading this, I simply don't 100% agree with the CPC saying it started in early December. Of course I'm just an average joe, so what do I know.

According to documents seen by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the Chinese government first detected a case of COVID-19 on Nov. 17. Yet it still hasn’t been able to confirm that this case really is the fabled “Patient Zero.”

Officially, the coronavirus didn’t exist until Dec. 31. The new leak of government documents therefore pushes the discovery of COVID-19 back by several weeks.

My husband, who did not know of COVID-19 at the time, looking back, thinks he may have had it back in December of 2019. He was sick the last day of a cruise (Caribbean cruise) with flu like symptoms and at the hotel after. He was also sick for about three weeks after we got home. He said it was the sickest he has ever been in his life including shortness of breathe. He could not shake it for another couple weeks after the initial illness. Makes me wonder ...

Also similar for two friends of ours in January. Same scenario after a cruise.

Me too, I had the worse chest pain I've ever had due to my extremely heavy cough. I took 4 days off work but returned with chest pain and a runny nose. I was incredulous at the people who said it was only a bad flu. I've had bad flu experiences and that wasn't it.

I know people are going to reply to this saying it's not possible. I had some crazy flu-like symptoms with SOB, and a cough that lasted close to two months and, during its peak, was horrific. I was trying to cough a lung up when I would cough. This was late November early December. I know, I know it's not possible, you'll say. Where I'm from, there were direct flights from China - not Wuhan, but other areas of the country. Even now - where I'm from, things are mild. I believe I had it and am looking forward to taking an antibody test to see if I did indeed have it.

If the Johns Hopkins dashboard is correct, ~4800 US deaths in the last 24 hours. Sitting at 30,826 total.

Speechless.

They could have a mistake there... or there is a sudden spike that does not mean more people suddenly dying. The same happened with France when they suddenly included all the people that dies outside of hospital.

Didn't CDC say something about changing the way they count the dead? It might be related to that.

Several states are revising their death counts as it becomes apparent that deaths originally considered pneumonia were actually Corona.

Not to mention what's being discovered in nursing homes. A nursing home in North Jersey was just found to have a morgue built to store 4 bodies had 17 stuffed in it plus 1 in a shed.

That happened in Spain as well.

At least in America senior citizens with no place else to go have their social security routed to a nursing home in exchange for staying there the rest of their lives. These nursing homes are hardly monitored by the government unless a formal complaint is made so places like this will neglect patients and even fail to report their deaths so they can continue collecting on their social security or reverse mortgages.

They're going to get finding bodies like this for months.

We had 31 people die in a nursing home in Quebec, Canada. The owners hid the outbreak and wouldn’t let relatives visit. The government is now sending inspectors to each and every nursing home. Over half the cases in the province are in nursing homes. It shows how badly this privatized portion of our health care system is being run.

In the States we're failing on both fronts.

Almost every major department in the US government is headed up by someone either not qualified, or replaced with someone clearly there to collect a paycheck. These people have no concern for what their departments actually do, and in no way plan to route resources to resolve these issues. After all if a problem us brought to light they might get blamed for it. So the US government won't create nor pay for the positions.

To top things off not only nursing homes, but even hospitals can't or won't provide the proper ppe required to keep their staff free of infection. Meaning over time available nurses and doctors will either quit one they've hit their breaking point, or become infected with the disease to the point they can't do their job or die trying to recover.

That is not the case. Hospital administrators are pressuring hospital staff to work without ppe and even in cases where they're experiencing Corona symptoms. The healthcare system is completely dollar driven and so medical supplies are taken into that equation.

Basically you have accountants running hospitals instead of doctors.

I am in Quebec, Canada. As a whole Canada has been handling this pretty well so far. Where I live we have half the cases of the whole country but most of those are in retirement homes. Specifically, public retirement and elder long term care facilities. We have 8+ homes with over 120 people living there and between 40 and 60% of residents are infected. Everyone is in their 80s or 90s. And they almost all die. Half the deaths here have been in those homes and 1/3rd have been from just 6 of those homes. It's a catastrophic failure of a system that the government runs.

As a whole I feel the provincial government has done a good job, but this is a major failure on their part. We had one home here where the staff just abandoned the place. I don't even like to think about how that ended up. Overall there are over 1200 employees from these facilities currently off of work. They are so short staffed because of this, the government is offering specialist and non-hospital doctors $250/hour to help with basic tasks at these facilities. Cleaning/feeding residents. There is also talk of the dental hygienists union offering their services.

My government is doing a good job protecting young seniors, millenials and younger... but they failed to protect the elderly and this will go down as a horrible tragedy. Much of Quebec's unique culture today was built and shaped by the generation that will suffer the most from this virus. They built the Quebec nation.

It's not a mistake, it's actually more like 2400+ for the day.

The CDC is also starting to count people who died outside of hospitals/nursing homes that are suspected to have had coronavirus. NY had a spike of 3700 yesterday evening based on that alone, but so far it looks like only MSNBC is counting that.

Several people protested the extended stay at home orders implemented by Michigan’s governor recently. Most showed up by gridlocking downtown Lansing. Others assembled in the streets. I feel proud to have the right to assemble and the people utilizing that right. However, I also feel infuriated that these people are putting the public and healthcare workers at an even greater risk. When is enough enough?

Everyone is starting to feel like a caged animal. People will proceed to be more irrational because they feel trapped at this point. What can curb this is offering psychological services at this point in time. I am a psychologist myself but I don't know where to offer my services.

That’s because NYC started counting the people who died in their homes likely due to Covid. This isn’t a change in biology, just accounting.

the 3,700 increase was added to the appropriate days, from here out you'll probably see a slight increase over the 2,000 standard for a while before declining again.

This will go until 2022, but as the outbreak progresses the measures that governments are going to use to fight this will change. You won’t be under a shelter in place order this time next year, although you probably won’t be able to go to a concert either.

Right now my state has $1k fines or 90 days in jail for visiting friends or family, driving to other residences that you own, etc. if I can’t see my family for 2 years I honestly don’t think I’ll survive I can’t live like this 2 years

Yes, it is because it implies the situation will remain like this for years, which isn't true. Life will almost certainly be different for a long time, but you'll have antibody tests, work if you can get it and certainly the ability to move around. However, there won't be large group gatherings. Air travel could be tricky because they'll probably need to put fewer people on a plane. So it'll either be much more expensive to fly because they'll be fewer flights and fewer seats or people will just stop flying unless absolutely necessary. IN which case it's harder to guess at the price.

Question about the mask thing. Our Governor (Polis, CO) is asking Coloradans to wear masks when outside. To what extent does this apply? For example, the nearest house to mine is an unoccupied 2nd home and about a quarter mile away. Should I be wearing a mask in my backyard? Is there potential to catch this thing just being outside?

It’s definitely better to forget you are wearing it when you don’t need to be, rather than the other way around. Also better to have nose and moth coverings that are comfortable and you can breathe through without effort. If you are the sort of person that fumbles around with bags and key fobs when you enter and exit the car, it might be just easier to leave your mask in place when you get in the car. Lastly it’s a social signal to say you are erring on over-caution about covid19, rather than under-caution.

So it’s not necessary. It just might be simpler for many people: set and forget.

It can be safer to leave it on the whole time you're out to avoid contaminating yourself or your hands. It serves no purpose in the car (unless you're driving through a crowded city area with your windows down or outside air venting into your face).

It makes sense to leave it on when in your car because the more you take it on/off the more you risk touching the mask with contaminated hands and then you’re just putting a contaminated mask back on your face.

If you’re going out it would be a good idea to put your mask on at home with clean hands, then leave it on until you get home and can either throw it away if it’s disposable or put it straight into the wash if it’s reusable.

If you’re just going out for a drive and don’t plan to leave your car or interact with anyone else then a mask probably isn’t necessary. But I guess it also depends where you live. I think some places are making mask wearing in public mandatory so maybe that means even when in your car.

Unless you're going to come close to someone, there is no need to wear one. So whenever you leave your house and have the possibility to come close to someone (grocery store, gas station, picking up takeout, etc.), you should wear one. You don't need to wear one while on your property though - coronavirus isn't airborne over long distances, that we know of. If it was able to spread miles airborne, we all would have gotten it within a span of weeks

I live there, I heard we added deaths from probable covid infections, those cases were not confirmed cases by laboratory test but suspected based on clinical symptoms. That’s why there is an increase.

I don’t think a prison style lockdown is actually necessary, with a reasonable shelter in place order it’ll take longer to peak sure, but both approaches should result in the curve being flattened below hospital capacity.

Best case scenario seems to be mid May or June. That really depends on how long it takes until the amount of active coronavirus cases starts to decline. Could be much later on if things don’t go well.

Look into getting Skype, Facebook messenger calls, other other video chat platforms to keep in touch with your boyfriend, friends, and teachers. You may also be able to do virtual sessions with your therapist if it is offered by your provider.

I hope I can post his here. Forgive me its a foolish question, but it's messing with my head. So I read there were over one hundred confirmed cases in Italy of people be being infected a second time, people who recovered and apparently not developing antibodies. This seems dire to me. Are people in fact recovering and proving resistance to reinfection? Isn't this necessary for a possible vaccine.

The studies aren’t peer reviewed, and it’s probably not a second infection, more likely a false negative when they recovered, or a false positive the second time

Agreed. From what I've read about different PCR testing standards this probably the case. However, from the early igG and igM antibody test being developed the total count of anitbodies is lower than expected given the propensity of mutation in SARS-COV2. Now, this could be attributed to poor antibody tests that got emergency approval from different regulatory agencies. The precision/accuracy of antigen/antibody tests across the board is all over the place. So knowing exactly what methodology is used in each individual study is important. Given how many non-science journalist are blasting out click-bate based articles on pre-prints these days, the articles you read are probably trash.

It is more and more common in South Korea too. The reports of bodies not developing immunity all the time were there for quite some time.

Any claims of things being alright after we have 'herd immunity' and that vaccine is ultimate solution were just speculations, not facts.

It is entirely possible that the virus is here to stay and it will only get better thanks to mutations, since mutations that kill their host too fast do not propagate as well, so in the end only less deadly versions would survive.

But as always, the research into what does and does not work will take months and before that happens, anyone claiming there is a magical solution they are sure about is lying.

A lack of antibodies does not nessecarily mean a lack of immunity, sometimes the body can produce antibodies quickly upon re exposure. And the high rates of false negatives (90% when a person is 20 days post symptoms onset) means most of those patients were likely mistakenly declared as recovered when they were in fact positive the whole time. In the end I think we will not know for sure until volunteers come forward and agree to be deliberately re-infected in a study that bypass the usual ethical standards.

We don’t know anything about immunity really. Fauci has said it is likely, if covid behaves like almost every other virus, that people have immunity for at least a period of time. But keep in mind covid tests have an extremely high rate of false negatives. I would assume those people had a false negative test and were infected the whole time

Your friend is hopeless and no amount of information you put in front of them would change their mind. Like the flat earth people. I'm assuming they showed you something like https://i.imgur.com/bcbKvUA.png

Which they say "like omg where there is 5g there is corona". Larger cities = more people coming in and out = international airports = higher density = higher chance of coronavirus coming in contact there. Farmer Bob in the middle of Kansas isn't travelling to China in January so it's unlikely that there would be an epicenter in rural Kansas. It only makes sense for the higher density cities with international airports to be the center of corona. 5G is just part of living in a big city. People don't understand how cell phone towers work so it's easy to convince them that's the cause. There's already scare of it causing cancer so not a big leap that a virus could come out of it. Add some spooky music and boom conspiracy

That’s the thing about this conspiracy— it’s so ridiculous that I don’t even know where to begin in terms of debunking it. Maybe that S.Korea has more prevalent 5G, for a longer period of time, and managed to contain their COVID outbreak successfully?

North Korea actually relies heavily on Chinese tourism for money. They shut foreign travel down in January, though, so they probably are doing fairly well in comparison to other countries in the region.

When were they born? If they were born in 2020 you will get the 500 dollars as a credit on your taxes when you file your 2020 taxes in 2021. You won't get the 500 as a check

If you're working you could decrease your tax withholding to get the 500 over your next few paychecks.

Would anyone be willing to work with me/help me construct a “realistic” statistic tracker? I feel like the deaths in the US are being severely undercounted. People are only being counted as a covid19 death if they die after being diagnosed with it. What about the 4-fold increase in heart disease related deaths or people dying at home or the undiagnosed? How are our numbers considered accurate when the underlying data doesn’t portray the entire situation? I want to try and build a model that accounts for these things. Or even a separate tracker for significant secondary cause of death favors

That would be especially hard since it goes both ways. Deaths that were not caused by COVID 19 complications are being counted if the person at any point tested positive for it. They've even counted suicides and accidental deaths as covid19. Youd be hard pressed to make a model that's any more realistic than what they've got now

What about accounting for people with underlying conditions that otherwise may have lived but due to the strain on medical centers, like in Italy, have died when they otherwise may have not? I found this article which was pretty interesting :

Yes, I certainly don't deny that the deaths are underreported, I'm just saying developing an accurate statistical model would be complex since you would have to take both misreporting and underreporting into account. I agree with everything you said, but your comment was about creating a more "realistic" statistical model, and I think it would be significantly more complicated than estimating covid deaths that were not counted. Because that wouldn't be "realistic" either unless you took the other direction into account. But overall, yes, deaths are underreported because if you're not in need of hospitalization, going out to get diagnosed won't benefit you. Better off just isolating until it's over or medical intervention becomes necessary. In general, most people have no real motivation to make sure it really is covid. Some need it confirmed if they're still working or have been around a large group of people, but for the rest of us; we're better off just isolating. Because of that, statistics can't be totally realistic.

But more power to you if you're that mathematically inclined that you can make a model!

Can someone tell me if being severely underweight (BMI 15 or less) puts someone at greater risk of death if they catch coronavirus? I can’t find information anywhere and I’m a little worried

They've only mentioned that overweight patients having increased morbidity. No news is likely good news on underweight so far.

A huge global traunch of data was just released yesterday though, so hopefully we'll be learning a lot more as more data scientists have access.

I think the key here is why someone is severally underweight. If it’s due to an eating disorder for example, the person is undoubtedly malnourished. With that in mind, I’d consider someone who is severely underweight because of an eating disorder to be at an elevated risk. Take people who died of various diseases in concentration camps as an example; the fact they were extremely malnourished did not help them fight the disease off in any way. There were other factors that also contributed to this, but sufficient nutrition (meaning consuming enough calories to allow your organs to fully function) is vital when it comes to fighting off illnesses.

Here’s a study that discusses how weight impacts hospitalization rates in sick patients: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304312/

Depend on if you are naturally thin or you have any underlying conditions. As long as your immune system is normal, you are not at a higher risk. But again, I don’t know why you are severely underweight. Like other people mentioned, overweight is a risk factor.

Hi! I have a friend who is getting a little delusional over COVID-19. He's finally started with some conspiracy talk, and I want to help shut it down.

One thing he mentioned that I am hopeful to disprove: "only 12% of deaths have actually been confirmed to be caused by COVID-19". I asked him for his source.

In the meantime, I am curious how one would go about finding the answer to a question like the following:

"How many more people have died, during COVID, compared to a similar time frame before COVID?"

Any input?

NYC has that data on their department of health website. not sure of other places though.

also, if 12% of all US deaths in a year was caused by covid that would be an insane overall number. that would be third to the number caused by cancer or heart attacks (both around 20%) at 1600 per day....oh wait, that's about what covid is killing daily right now. err, um?

I came here to complain about the same thing! It's frustrating, when people will go through every mental gymnastic move possible to convince themselves that they are right, and it's difficult to look the other way when their attitude could endanger people. I'm struggling with whether or not to just ignore those people. They seem really entrenched. One guy kept comparing the numbers to the swine flu. Managed to convince him he was wrong because he was comparing a year of swine flu to the early stages of the Covid pandemic. But then he came back and said it's ok that all those people die because religion and freedom and 10M people "die of abortion so that's what we really should be worried about". It's hard to say who is worth pointing in the right direction...if anyone.

The average number of Americans that die each day is about 7,700. And for this month that’s pretty close to the same. So that number has gone up by about 1500-2000 pretty much daily for the last few weeks.

The 12% number is the icing on the cake. Your friend is playing the correlation does not equal causation game. Just like the tobacco companies did for years. Just like Exxon Mobile does with climate change. And that’s right. Correlation does not equal causation, but I wouldn’t start pounding down a pack of Marlboro reds each day. Incidentally, there is pretty clear proof tobacco does, in fact, cause lung cancer. The mechanism has been worked out for about 20 years.

Bottom two graphs, you see a nice uptick of the all cause mortality rates. Just after the flu spike that is pretty obviously in trend / season. Need a bit more data to say conclusively but these system are slow.

I am so sad that my country (the Philippines) has not been handling this pandemic well. We have the highest deaths in SEA; we are also ranked the least safe country to have the disease in Asia-Pacific because the efforts of this government have been truly unsatisfying. The current admin is extremely corrupt. Even the Department of Health has been making questionable decisions. We have only tested 40,000+ times (not individuals because a person can be tested multiple times until he becomes negative) and it’s already the middle of April. We are truly acting without sense of urgency, and our president still sucks up to China. People are already tired of fighting this rotten government. I wish my country had voted for a more capable, selfless, and intelligent politicians. I am sorry for the rant.

One possibility:

If one country has more access to testing, then people with mild syntoms get tested, and most people who test positive will live.

If you don't have enough test, then you only test those who are in the worst condition, and the death rates among that group is going to be higher.

I don't know anything specific about these countries, and testing efforts, I'm only laying it out as a possibility.

The UK probably has way more actual infections than Turkey. They are reporting a similar number of confirmed new infections every day simply because both countries are probably running the same number of tests each day.

Until a few days ago, UK was only testing people who presented at hospital. Those are obviously already in a bad way and more likely to die than the 80% of mild cases which right now may be untested

Essential UK case figure is waaaaay higher than reported, so death rate is larger by proportion.

Should you isolate within your home if you've only been exposed to COVID-19?

Long story short: my wife's elderly father got COVID-19. He doesn't live with us, but after he collapsed at home, she thought it was because he is diabetic and not taking his meds, so she ran over there and helped pick him up off the floor (while wearing a mask). Eventually, he collapsed enough times that he agreed to go to the hospital (the EMTs took him) and there he tested positive for COVID-19, even though he didn't have any respiratory issues.

So now my wife has been around him and he has it and we decided, out of an abundance of caution, to have her isolate within our house and stay away from me and our two young children until we know whether she has it or not. We asked her doctor, who only quoted CDC guidance which says TO isolate if you have symptoms. Obviously, we know people can be contagious when they are pre-symptomatic so waiting for symptoms seems like a risky move. There's also a strong possibility that we already caught it from her, if she has it, because we didn't know about her father's infection and we didn't make the decision to isolate until she had been here spending time with the family for two days.

Meanwhile, however, she's stuck in our basement for 14 days and I am doing 100% of the childcare while trying to do my day job. So far, she's been unable to get tested because she has no symptoms, even though testing would allow us to figure out if she could come out of isolation. So, if we are going according to the letter, she should live in the basement for two weeks , even if she never gets sick.

We are all quarantining in the house. Nobody is going out. The question is whether she needs to isolate herself from the rest of the family within our house. The rest of the family consists of me and the kids and we all had contact with her before she moved into the basement to isolate. The question is whether we are already screwed so let her back upstairs or keep her away to prevent us from catching it because she might not have "shed" the virus within the time period between her exposure and her self isolation. If we are all screwed anyway, she could move out of the basement and help care for our kids.

Doctor was very vague, just sent her an email copying and pasting the CDC guidelines which say to isolate IF you have symptoms (which she does not yet), but don't mention what to do if you've been exposed but have no symptoms.

QUESTION: Scientists seems to be in consensus regarding the mortality rate for Covid-19. Somewhere between 0.5 % to 3%, give or take. Now, in my country, Sweden, we've had 11 927 confirmed cases to date. Deaths connected to Covid-19 is 1 203. That is a mortality rate of roughly 10%. Yet we're expecting a loss of life, globally, to cap out at maximum 3 percent? Please help me understand the reasoning or point out what I'm missing. Explain it to me like I'm a child, please, I really do wish to understand.

Sweeden probably has way more cases than confirmed cases. Social distancing has been pretty limited and the population is generally healthy (resulting in more non serious cases)

Alright.. so the unreported cases would make up for the percentage gap, in this case that would be somewhere between 70 000 and 100 000 sick individuals where a fraction is reported in?

By what I understand, you can't take the total mortality rate from the number of diagnosed cases and the fatalities that we have so far. Because the epidemic is still ongoing, we don't know how many people have the disease or how many are going to continue to die. The mortality rate you see currently doesn't necessarily reflect the overall mortality rate. I learned this here:

AFAIK, the CERB is tied to Employment Insurance. So you cannot voluntarily resign and receive the payment. https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application/confirmation.html

There is a criteria to stop due to illness, but I would get an expert opinion if GAD would qualify.

He can't stop it if he wanted to constitutionally speaking. Congress and executive may not fund it, but it is a necessity and states that care will find general revenue to print ballots. The states that don't will have neighbors that do and their constituents will be envious. It is an inevitability.

I joke, but also it's not unlikely.

a very vocal portion of our current president's supporters believe him to be fighting a "deep state conspiracy" that includes several intelligence agencies and departments of government. if he loses, I have little doubt that his base will protest and claim it to be a political takeover. if he wins, I see the same potential for protests from his opposition, who generally believe him to be an ineffective president, if not an outright corrupt one.

with either outcome I see a sizable pissed off crowd of Americans who see their country under threat. add an unprecedented rate of unemployment, homelessness, and illness, and my friend you've got yourself an incredibly unstable country

No. We’ve been doing much better tbh.

Where I live, every single person non essential to societies function (infrastructure workers, delivery, etc) have been ordered to stay at home for almost a month now and been receiving 80% of their wage from the government to do so with self employed people getting aid packages too. They also imposed isolation on the borders and won’t even let residents from here return if they were abroad.

Meanwhile you lot have a government pissing and moaning about giving you a little one time support payment, saying the virus is a hoax, not limiting the spread, undermining the WHO and sending your healthworkers to die with no PPE, all of which is happening in a country with no nationalized healthcare system that almost every other western nation has.

The US is doing much much worse, and will get much much much worse.

This isn’t a competition bub I’m glad you guys are doing everything right and We’re doing it wrong. Seems like the UK has its problems too though. Couldn’t care less about politics or whatever anymore... I just want to go outside, not get fired and reschedule my trip to go see my family in the UK. I’ve been in my house five weeks

I’m not trying to make it a competition, I just really struggle to emphasize to Americans how f***ing backwards and primitive your government is handling the situation whilst simultaneously chugging out the message you’re leading the global fightback against be virus.

It’s really scary for you lot and I feel sorry for the people the government is dragging through the mud to protect the rich.

It will depend heavily on the future spread of the disease as well as on every country. Plenty of government official inside EU are already talking about non-essential travel abroad being restricted at least until next year.

Their current status is sort of complicated in the transitional period. But UK is currently the European country seeing the fastest and largest spread of the disease. The possibility of them being under lockdown for longer is currently pretty high. Safe bet would be to not make any travel plans in any foreseeable future.

Some of the officials said the US intends for China pay a price, but recognize the US has to be careful not to inflict a cost on China before the pandemic is under control and until they have more information about its creation.

So from what I've heard surgical masks stop you from spreading the virus but not contracting it right. So virus particles can't exit but they can enter. So why don't we just wear the masks inside out?

A surgical mask doesn’t provide a proper seal. So there is a risk of breathing in the infection.

It’s more about reducing the spread of your own droplets coming from your respiratory system. If you cough with a mask on those large droplets are mostly stopped at the mask and not the full distance they can travel. They can still exit though.

A surgical mask works in blocking large droplets and doesn’t protect against small droplets. Coronavirus can be as small as .06 microns. An N95 is most effective at blocking 0.3 microns.

If a sick person not wearing a mask cough or spits large particles in the air go to your mask and can collect those particles. The mask may be effective though to a point but it’s not fully decided yet.

The most ideal situation is for everyone to wear a mask or face covering. It limits the spread to other but should not be a safety net from staying 6 feet away from others. Everyone treats themselves as a carrier of the virus to protect others around them.

I don’t know this for sure, but it seems like grocery store workers are younger on average. So they probably just die less because they aren’t old. I’m just putting that possibility out there, but I don’t have solid evidence for this claim.

I am not going to link the video, because my assumption is that the mods here remove it.

There is a well known Youtuber who is an American expat that is fluent in Chinese and lived in China and documented it for many years - his channel is 'LaoWhy86'. He moved back to the USA last year.

He released a video titled "I Found The Source of the Coronavirus" two weeks ago. It is very measured in tone and shows screenshots of web result to support his claims. He does NOT make any allegations about weapons or other malicious behaviour. I'd like to find dispassionate analysis of legitimacy of his claims.

The gist is that there is a virus research lab in Wuhan where they were researching coronavirus in bats. They had poor safety standards and PPE. A researcher there is purported to be alive and well but some suspect they died. They listed two job listings for researchers, and the second one says "they made a big discovery in human transmissibility and need more help to deal with it." This news article supports the claims about job listings.

Matthew Tye, who creates YouTube videos, contends he has identified the source of the coronavirus — and a great deal of the information that he presents, obtained from public records posted on the Internet, checks out.

My issue is there are no discussions of this on bigger forums. The results on reddit are only posts smaller or fringe subreddits. The fact that it cannot be found on this subreddit, where it would be on topic and interesting, leads me to assume the mods are treating it as misinformation or anti-China propaganda. I do not want to get banned.

Has this video been discussed and analysed anywhere that checks his claims, his evidence etc. i.e. does it appear to be legit or not?

You mean this one right? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpQFCcSI0pU

I saw it, checked out the sources, and it's a pretty legit theory in my opinion. Yeah it doesn't fill all the holes but it's a good foundation for continued investigation. Also I'm like the last person to buy into conspiracy theories, and am the first to disprove them, if that means anything.

Whose quote is that, because it's brilliant.

Incompetence completely explains the situation; China tried to cover up the lab accident, ended up causing a pandemic. Of course they would want to cover it up, that makes them look extremely incompetent.

This video isn't claiming the virus was man-made or spread on purpose. Quite the contrary, they state the virus was natural and spread from bats in a cave to nearby villagers close to Wuhan.

Scientists took samples to research, once scientist accidentally got infected. The Chinese government tried to control the situation by containing the one scientist but she ended up infecting the rest of the lab staff anyways. This research was being conducted in the Wuhan CDC, which is 300 meter away from the Huanan Seafood Market that the virus is claimed to have originally spread. It was very easy for them just to pin it on the wet market, I'm sure some lab staff even visited it sometime considering the close proximity.

Assuming a 0.5% death rate, how many will actually be infected in the long run though?

Because if only 10% of Americans get the virus, that'll be over 160k deaths..and it's certain that there will be more than 10% infected.

How unsafe is alcohol? I am 27 years old with no health problems. Would two drinks a week be dangerous? The wording in the news articles is unclear. Is it like drinking while pregnant, where there is no safe amount, or is it like a sliding scale?

Ah okay got you. Well in the UK NHS guidelines state

"To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level if you drink most weeks:

Men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis 

Spread your drinking over three or more days if you regularly drink as much as 14 units a week

If you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week

The NHS makes it clear that there is no ‘safe’ limit when drinking alcohol. The measures above are considered ‘low-risk'"

So yeah no entirely safe level of consumption but your two drinks a week are about as low risk as you can get.

Edit: For clarification units does not equal one drink, refer to guidelines for info on units, but two drinks a week is still way below.

If you're male, you can have 2 drinks a day and be considered safe still. Female is 1.

While it's true that alcohol does lower your immune system, 2 drinks a day, and certainly 2 drinks a week isn't going to lower it to the point that you're going to end up in the ICU.

TLDR: you're fine. Drink on friend (in moderation).

Let us remember this, the Gov Cuomo demanded 30,000 ventilators and said 26,000 could die if he didn’t get them. He didn’t get them and 26K didn’t die for lack of them. Now...he's giving away the ones he has. Why the hell is NY the gold standard when OH and CA are so much more impressive in how they handled matters?

New York has gotten more publicity because they’ve had the worst outbreak. And Cuomo has said the right things during the outbreak. This of course ignores the cavalier tone that Cuomo and de Blasio took leading up to the outbreak.

Every night I go to sleep hoping that there will be some good news. Recovery actually being real. Recovery providing permanent, or at least long-lasting, immunity. A broad range of species NOT able to be infected by it. The disease not just lowering people slowly until everyone is dead. Some good antiviral treatment. It actually being possible to make a vaccine for it.

But it just never comes. Why? I think most people are good. I don't want everyone to die!?

I believe the majority of people are good as well and this virus and the crazy consequences of it are terrifying if you only look at what you just listed. I understand the natural reaction is to inevitably see it as some sort of slow moving apocalypse but, we're going to be ok. Not everyone is going to die. Stay at home. Help slow the spread. Wear face masks. During this time keep a few things in mind when it starts to raise your anxiety. Slowing the spread down, we're doing that to buy time. We are currently in the most medically advanced era ever. We will find something. Everyone is working on this. I assure you, we will find something. We only need time. The other thing to keep in mind are mutations. It's already mutated a couple times. Mutations can of course be bad but, for the most part, mutations are good. You have to keep in mind that the virus wants to replicate, it wants to multiply. Just like us, it wants to continue on. Because of that, by default, it doesn't want to kill the host. As a natural progression it should slowly mutate into something less deadly. All we need is time. Yes, it's scary. It sucks. It's going to difficult for a while but, we will find a way to beat this.

Not everyone is going to die. There are 7.8 billion people in the world. If the virus has a death rate of 6 percent (which is high), that leaves 7.3 billion people alive.

Remember the freak out last week when Trump said New York didn’t need as many ventilators as claimed?

There's a world of difference between preparing for the worst and having that not come true due to your active mitigation efforts, and idly hoping for the best as an excuse for doing absolutely nothing.

You don't get to turn a Cuomo assisting other states in to anyting pro Trump. Any reduction in casualties, any reduction in deaths is on the New York state government not the federal government.

the states wouldn't have had to been scrambling and preparing for the worst case scenario if POTUS put down as f***en golf game or political rally grandstanding and actually started working on this in January, December, or even November when it was first briefed.

It was all wrapped up for a bow, all he needed to do was follow the pandemic playbook developed by GWB. I think the only failing and planning for the playbook was that they didn't make a pictogram playbook design for a five year old mind.

"Japan urges citizens to isolate as reports warn of 400,000 deaths"

Jesus Christ. Give me a break.

Japan has 146 deaths -- a country of 127 million people. They are an hour away from China. Thus far, since the the crisis began, they have only had 146 deaths -- without any lockdowns or nasty authoritarian measures.

The problem is that the "models" don't account for all of the cultural/social/procedural things Japan does -- and China does not do! -- to keep its death rate so low.

China on a "lockdown" is still a less hygienic and orderly society -- with a less advanced health care system -- than Japan on a regular day. The "models" don't account for this.

400,000 deaths? Jesus Christ.

You seriously think Japan risks 400,000 deaths? If so, why just 146 deaths so far, despite being an hour away from China and not having had any lockdowns? Shouldn't Japan at least have a few thousand deaths already?

except Japan is next door to China and has had COVID19 cases for far longer than the U.S., with a lot more Chinese flights seeding the country. if 400,000 deaths was realistic, one would think that some of these deaths would have already happened over the past four months when no social distancing or lockdowns have occurred? symptoms appear within 14 days -- they don't take 120 days to appear.

also, Japan has an exceptional culture that's far more hygienic than China. models can't account for this.

Coronavirus is shaking things up. That's needed. We have a stagnant society of people addicted to social media, tv sports, video games, false religions, meaningless jobs, cooking shows, and lots more.

This should be viewed as an opportunity to do things differently. At least on an individual level.

Can anyone research why people have this for 2+ months? They are suffering, being sick for this long. If a disease as nasty as this is permanent, then most will simply drop in months, with the rest lingering for years.

I know my writing comes across as screaming, but if this thing cannot be removed by the immune system, like HIV, what do people expect to happen?

well considering it causes permanent lung damage, or at least damage that takes a long time to heal, it's not surprising. Respiratory problems can linger for quite a long time, I've heard of people testing positive for possibly a month straight, but most likely that's not common. 2 months of actually having the virus seems unlikely.

Are you referring to the swine flu epidemic, or something else? Swine flu in 2009 killed a total of 14,286 from January 2009 thru August 2010.

So far in the United States alone we have over 28,000 deaths since our first death on February 29- just 6 weeks into this thing.

It’s more serious because it’s more contagious, more deadly, more widespread, has a longer incubation period which allows for presymptomatic people to spread it undetected, and appears to cause fatal cytokine storms in healthy people with no underlying illness.

Because we are only 2.5 months into this and over 100k people have died. I know there half as many deaths as the 2009 flu pandemic, but that flu pandemic didn’t kill nearly as many people in the first 2.5 months as the coronavirus has.

And there wasn’t nearly as much social distancing with the 2009 flu pandemic as there is now. If we didn’t do these lockdowns we are right now, the death toll would have probably been in the millions by now.

2009 was a variation on the H1N1 virus which we had a vaccine for, so a new vaccine was just tweaking the current one, which took a couple of months. CoVid is a variation on the coronavirus which has no vaccine, so a brand new vaccine needs to be developed, think no less than 2 years. Researchers have been working on a caronavirus vaccine for 40 or so years to combat SARS. Imagine how bad 2009 would have been without a vaccine and you can imagine why CoVid makes people panic.

Here's my question: I bought a second-hand object from someone. I told them to place it in a cardboard box, I put the box in a plastic bag and then left it in my room for two days (thinking if I should make it three), preferably in the sun. Would that get rid of the virus? Because I heard it doesn't survive longer than a day on paper and cardboard and in warmer temperatures.

I'm still thinking why the number of cases in China is much less. Don't just repeat they are lying. They are gradually opening the country right? I mean China has more and dense population. They had no prior information about the virus. At least other countries get more than nothing right? No one could tell how infectious it is before it spread. China was on its Chinese new year, when people travel back to home all over the country. I can't see any of the country in the world have a tougher situation than China. Why can't we do better than them, if China is incompetence? I doubt the pandemic would be much worse if it start in US or Italy. Then why China deserves the blame?

Does anyone believe the situation could be better if the pandemic starts somewhere else than China?

The CCP arrested and censored a doctor who was trying to tell the government about the virus. He would later die of the virus. That's why China -- the CCP -- deserves quite a bit of blame.

Yeah, but there's also not millions infected than 100,000s of dead. So they do seem to have stopped the spread in China. There's no way it could still be spreading at this point and not have become very visible to the outside world.

The death numbers are definitely WAY under-reported, most Chinese bloggers used the urn pickup (government only released the remains recently) to estimate the true death numbers of Wuhan to be at least 60k, and the city has a population of 11 million, so even if only half the deaths is due to covid the official number is still off by 10x. To be fair, the Chinese government never said that 3000 was the total, they said it was the confirmed total, and it's plausible that the bulk of the deaths happened in the early days way before tests could confirm anything. Other countries have also chosen to not include probable cases in their numbers, but with the Chinese government it will probably be decades before they release an official estimate. I was more angry with the Chinese government before I saw a comparable downplay/we-don't-want-people-to-panic/silence scientists pattern play out in other countries, but their refusal to acknowledge responsibility for the initial f***up is unforgivable. That being said, the subsequent response was swift and well organized, and I think the current immunity passport (Green Codes as they call it) seems to be as functional as any system can be and it's a pity that other countries will not learn from it due to distrust of any data coming out of China these days.

Yeah exactly. The underrepoting in China should and was worse than other countries. But keep in mind China had to make the tests from scratch. No doubt the tests were very limited. Also, I think people usually misunderstand China as a consistant individual. It was majorly governors of Hubei province downplayed the crisis. It was them covered up the virus until central government in Beijing sent out investigation group led by Zhong Nanshan, who later decleared human-to-human transimition is happening and announced lockdown of Wuhan. Although it is not transparent, they must had a hard debate to make the decision of lockdown Wuhan. I believe that was the turning point Chinese government finally fixed those mistakes they made. What I want to say is that, the coverup might not be done in the will of central government, and they fixed the problem before it was too late. In Trump's word, they would have done a great great great job. It's just not possible for a country of that size to make no mistake. It was not too late to fix it since there were few cases around the world. Why keep blaming for the 10 point they lost, and ignore the other 90 out of 100 they did?

I wouldn't call the Chinese incompetent. They run a massive bureaucracy keeping tabs on the movement and communication of 1.5 billion people. They use their authoritarian powers to lockdown Wuhan and any other outbreak locations very hard and imposed a level of tracking that can't be matched in the west because they'd be illegal.

I know a lot of shade is being thrown China's way, but there was about a 9 day delay between when the outbreak started and the central government announced to the world what was going on. I don't think other countries would have done much better, and you want to re-enforce countries to be open with this, so punishing them might not lead to the right response in the future.

China covered up yes. China said they could handle the crisis and I think they didn't lie about that. What is most imporant to stop the spread I believe, is that people take the virus seriously. US has the most cases because the Trump government said it was flu and social distancing could never be in place with it. It took a long time for Chinese government to convince their people to stop gathering with their propaganda machine. The west didn't believe the 2% death rate announced by China. No one would say that is a flu. The fact west doesn't trust China and ignored some info from China is another problem.

It gets many kids who couldn't otherwise afford college a chance at a higher education and brings a lot of money to universities.

The money that sports bring in pays for the scholarships. So scholarships aren't taken away from non-athletes or anything. I fail to see a negative

So making poor kids focus on sports instead of excelling in their studies, just to afford it? How about instead of making everything a financial product making an amendment in constitution that says that education is a basic human right? Might wipe out the differences between poor and rich a bit more than sports scholarship.

Sure, if that happened, athletic scholarships wouldn't be necessary, but that isn't our current reality. As it stands, it is a fantastic program.

If we got rid of college athletics, universities probably wouldn't see much of a difference as far as academics go. You're talking about getting rid of something that in no way takes away anything from anyone.

We will not be in lockdown for 2 years. We will all be back to work by August at the very latest.

I’m sorry, I know 18 months is the “minimum” but basically everyone actually involved in developing vaccines or with the FDA has not really hidden the fact that they’re about to rush vaccines unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. 18 months is the minimum for your typical vaccine, but whatever the hell we are getting will have basically no long term stats.

Shit, I’ll be quite honest, I fully expect they’ll hit shot one of the early vaccines to try and buy time for one of the ones made by the major vaccine companies to do the time necessary to go through all the protocol. I grew expect we’re getting a stop gap vaccine long before we see the one that actually ends this once and for all

Of course there will not be a total lockdown for that long. But neither may things get to normal completely. Given that students going on spring vacation were one of the primary ways of spreading the disease, large concentrations of young people and allowing them to travel is certainly something that will come as one of the last things to be allowed.

We can resume with masks and social distancing. And localized shorter-term lockdowns in hot spots. Shorter because of sufficient testing, contact tracing, and quarantines.

Masks and social distancing will be a thing for the next 18-24 months.

I don’t know how to tag other people, but one of the users Anothersoul shared a video that might be in relation to this information. They probably know more than I do.

https://youtu.be/bpQFCcSI0pU

CNN just reported on it, Washington Post, and Forbes so it has possibly some credibility.

It would make sense but a government cover up would be really bad deal in my opinion.

If reliable sources reported on it, why on earth do you give a YouTube link? I’ll tell you what it looks like. It looks like you’re trying to spread misinformation and are citing some big newspaper names to back up your claims and make your fantasies more believable.

Is this what you’re doing? I don’t know, I’d have to check legitimate sources. But it sure looks like it.

Oh jeez. All I said was a video was posted earlier and it might be related to the information that they are investigating. Key word is might.

There is an actual source in the original post. I named off other left leaning news agencies reporting on it because people some get offended over Fox News

I also didn’t make any claims for any fantasy. I just noted that the original source that was posted would make sense and a government coverup would be bad.

I doubt it. We may see a level of international cooperation instead.

Covid has also affected the economy everywhere; people will join up for money and benefits, negating the need for draftees. (Militaries don't enjoy drafting people, generally. You want people who choose to be there.)

This is not a thing that I would worry about if I were you.

Would I be stopped if I were to do a cross-country road trip to watch the Space X rocket launch in May? It's a pretty historic launch with it being the first manned launch of a private rocket and if I stay in my car the whole way I wouldn't be exposing anyone to anything. I've been at home for 3 weeks and was looking forward to this launch.

Edit: I realize I may be coming off as one of the stupid people trying to travel and party, but I fully intend on packing sandwiches and traveling as if I was in a spaceship and not getting out of my car unless to go into a McDonald's to go the bathroom or a gas station for gas. I'm also not sick nor have I come into contact with anyone who (as far as I know) has been infected.

I’m in Oklahoma. It’s launching from Florida. I’m banking on all the states between us being too stupid to enforce stay at home orders, so as long as I stay in my car and pack sandwiches enough for 3-4 days of traveling I shouldn’t have any issue or exposure.

Wow. Opposed to everyone else here, I think that sounds like a great plan! I mean, I don't see it any different to grocery shopping while social distancing. It's even safer as you are secluded from any physical interaction, severely decreasing the risk of exposure. Just avoid touching anything and have a happy trip!

I read the article earlier today. I remember that it was on FOX News and maybe that’s why nobody is talking about it. But I also read another one saying that it’s so contagious because it has 4 extra proteins which is not normal for an animal (bat) virus. That it would have been man made. I went back to find the story and can’t find it anywhere. I’m curious about it so I came here to check it out but I couldn’t find anything.

Idea: Global Devaluation.

What if to fund the Massive Stimulus needed to reboot the World Economy from its doldrums from lockdowns, business failures, depleted budgets, massive unemployment and depressed tax revenues that countries around the world simply agree to a coordinated Global Devaluation of their currencies. This would mean the Printing Presses could run at full steam in every country and print an agreed upon amount money, let's say 25% of 2019 GDP, to help offset the costs of the virus. A uniform amount printed by each country would head off trade imbalances, capital flight etc.

Poke holes in my idea. What's wrong with this strategy? (Aside from World Leaders never being able to agree on anything)

I'll attempt, though I'm no expert. Let's say the value of $200 before this could buy you groceries for a week for your family. If the value of the dollar plummets, stores won't charge the same amount. It will now cost you $500 for groceries, or more. Think of it this way. I mean, there's nothing stopping the government from just depositing $1,000,000 in everybody's bank accounts. But as soon as everybody becomes millionaires, the value of a million dollars is miniscule.

They're doing basically double the testing of every other country, have some of the least deaths of a populated country, and seem to be doing well.

Why not ease some of the restrictions if they have it fairly under control?

Ok so my question is, you have a mask on to prevent others getting infected. But would it not be good to do that, for the fact you would keep inhaling the virus and having possibly keep reinfecting your self, and is there a way to clean your mask so you can reuse?

Once you’re infected, you’re infected. The titer of what’s in your breath is nothing compared to the titer in your bronchioles. The only way that virus is going away is if your immune system can kill it.

It will never come from the state level. They can issue bonds, but a lot of states can't run deficits by their own state constitutions. Those who can are completely unable to cover the costs of paying out to all their citizens. The only entity that can pull this off is the federal gov't. At 0.6% for a ten year note, the feds can spend an awful lot of money right now. So long as tax revenues rise faster than those treasuries mature, they will have no trouble paying them back.

So I have a question. My husband is an ICU nurse. Took care of some COVID pts last week during his shift. He’s been quarantined since. It’s been about 5 days and suddenly tonight he’s gotten a mildly sore red throat. No fever. No other symptoms. Should we be worried or just chalk it up to allergies? Thanks!

Yeah. It just sucks that we literally know nothing about this crap. There’s no way to know anything. Our county isn’t testing people with mild symptoms purely out of effort to convince the governor to reopen businesses. So he won’t get tested unless he were to need hospitalization.

no because they weren't running it, the European FIFA called UEFA were responsible for intercontinental matches but at the end of the day most of the matches and even the intercontinental ones could have been cancelled by local authorities but they didn't do it

I think you should return the abillity to make text posts, so we can make discussion posts or when news are based on a non-english source, so you can translate, this subreddit wasn't made for news only after all...

The 1st amendment says that we have the right to assemble, so isn’t it wrong for states to enforce lockdowns?

A document written 244 years ago is set in a pretty different context and open to revision if the situation calls for it. That's why they're called 'amendments'.

Sorry that other people aren’t answering you, it’s a fair and interesting question whether you agree with the lockdowns or not. Based on what I’ve read it is constitutionally questionable, but based on recent studies it seems that Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are surprisingly willing to tolerate civil rights violations in order to protect against the virus.

It’s not just about lockdowns but about questions like: can there be criminal penalties for spreading misinformation? Can you force quarantine people in government facilities? Can you prohibit certain people from entering the country? Can you conscript healthcare professionals to work when it’s putting their lives in danger?

Edit: why are people downvoting facts?

Why does it seem that those whom hate Trump seem to want the fatality rate to be higher, the pain to extend longer, the economy to fall further, the shut-ins to last longer?

Are they science deniers because of their politics?

I hate Trump. I want as few people as possible to die. I am upset about his poor handling of things and won't be surprised if more die as a result.

I wish for once in his life, he could put others ahead of himself and not try to make this about him. It's not about him.

No true. We hate Trump because this is way worse than it needed to be if he'd taken it seriously in January and February.

Now we just want him to stop messing with the States as they try to get things under control and reopen.

No, because it was already starting to spread in the US and what was needed was ramping up testing, contact tracing and coordinating resource stockpiles across the country.

I think you're generalizing based on a select segment of this sub's population that happens to be anti-Trump and a doomer.

In America, at least, the science deniers tend to be Trump supporters, not haters.

That's on you. No one wants people to die or to be quarantined longer than necessary ffs.

Trump supporters have been saying "dems want millions to die" for weeks on reddit. No democrats have actually said that. It's a conspiracy theory feedback loop.

To answer you, seeds aren't banned. You can still buy them online and pickup or smallet hardware stores. Vermont did the exact same thing. The order is just for big retailers to stop people shopping because they are bored

Michigan has not banned the sale of American flags in the state. While the governor is now requiring that large stores cut off some sections of stores concerning gardening and home improvement, these supplies can still be bought online. I get that it says false, but its banning seeds from being sold in stores, hence...

Well where I am all home/hardware/garden stores are closed to shoppers but we can order online and do curbside pickup of anything we need. I wouldn't consider that a ban on seeds, or lumber, or anything else I need for my home.

In the US I don't think they're banned, but some stores are restricting sales to items that are considered essential. Though frankly, if this keeps up, seeds might be essential.

Y’all know the fatality rate is nowhere near 3.4%—-possibly only .34%. Get off CNN and read some science journals. What did trump expose us to? It’s looking more and more like the common flu season?

I'm 25, but weigh 335 pounds, have high blood pressure and frequent irregular heartbeats. I'm greatly suicidal and actively want to die. I don't want my family to know I wanted it though. So, if I did everything I could to catch COVID, how likely is it that I would die?

If you managed to catch it, it's more likely that you'd just have a couple of sucky weeks that made it feel like you were dying.

And you'd be another person in a crowded hospital, taking up room and resources from other sick people. Intentionally. Avoidably.

Don't do this. Talk to someone. Get some help.

I'm not even gonna try and convince you to want to live but

Please don't intentionally catch the plague and risk taking down others with you or risk being found unconscious and wasting a hospital bed if you don't even want to live.

Please consider if drowning in your own fluids and blood and pus, gasping for air, hooked to a breathing tube, restrained so you don't rip it out in your panicked air-starved fever delirium, bedridden for maybe weeks, is really the way you wanna go out (bc it sounds like a living hell to me)

Please seek mental health help.

I was suicidal for almost 20 years of my life, and ended in a spiral that resulted in massive drug addiction. I finally broke down when I was 35 mostly because I wanted to stop suffering.

Now at the age of 40 I’m having the best year of my life.

I’m not saying everyone can do what I did. But what I do know is that life can turn itself around and you owe it to yourself to see if you can. Maybe you can’t, but then again I didn’t believe it was possible for me to either.

As someone who also struggles with mental illness and am pretty sure I have it... you don’t want this. It almost definitely won’t kill you but personally, in my case, it made my mental illness way worse. It’s having a bizarre effect on my mental state and I feel batshit crazy. I feel like the media is only reporting on deaths and treating it like really bad flu but I think they’re going to find out down the line that it particularly f***s with the mentally ill.

Also, in attempting to contract it you are also putting others at risk because you could be an asymptomatic carrier. Call a crisis hotline and your local emergency rooms and see if you can get at least temporarily medicated. Good luck.

You don’t want to die like that. You’re drowning with COVID. You don’t want to drown. What you need to do is find a personal therapist, and probably get on some anti-depression meds. It’s a long haul, and no one says it’s easy but what you’ll find is life is worth living again. You’ll be thankful you did it. I’m not kidding. I’ve been there myself.

I went on a walk around my neighborhood last night without a mask. Walked blocks and blocks, saw no one. Suddenly I walked right by a smoker standing on the curb. I was maybe five feet or so in from the curb. He was facing away from me but I did catch a good whiff of his smoke, certainly walked through a bit of it. If he were infected how probable that I was exposed through his secondhand smoke?

China didn't warn public of likely pandemic for 6 key days
Top Chinese officials secretly determined they were likely facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus in mid-January, ordering preparations even as they downplayed it in public.

This is bad but you know what's worse the USA doing effectively nothing to prepare the country from the middle of the January till the start of March. They did a couple things to attempt to prevent the virus from getting here but effectively nothing to prepare if it did.

Selection bias. The only people who have stuck around to religiously read this subreddit are the very young and very online crowd. Aka the r/politics core demo. Most normal people have already moved on to thinking about other things.

If it was cancelled you’re entitled to a refund, contact the airline directly and if they don’t respond chargeback on your credit card. Book another flight when safe to do so, we don’t know the future. If you really wanna change just wait and keep trying but I don’t see the point when you can just get your money back and rebook. In the future use google flights it’s better than sky scanner

What is your pie hole spewing?

Between the payroll protection, CERB, GST and family bonus top-ups. Utility rate protections, eviction prevention, tax deadline advancement.

Not to mention we have Universal Health protections, no surprise five or six figure bill for getting the disease. Even if you're unemployed, even if you were Snowbird just returning.

Then there's the whole fact we started social distancing well before the American started locking down.

Don't get me wrong there's some dumb things Canada has done as well. Borders and Air transport are the big two.

You need to have lost a job due to covid19. Unemployment numbers are about 1 million, ~3% of the population.

I think America's stimulus program is $1200 to every American earning under 75k. Canada's stimulus program is the same amount usd equivalent to every Canadian who's lost a job due to Covid19.

I'm Canadian, but I live in the US. I might be a bit biased, but I think Canada's program makes a lot more sense and will help a lot more. My wife and I make too much to get a check in the US, but I know a lot of people who are still working, and getting a check they really don't need. That money should be going directly to people who have been affected by COVID-19 (mostly meaning, lost their jobs).

A single $1,200 payment isn't going to do much for most people. Maybe keep your car from being repossessed one month. Or maybe it pays for part of a single month's rent, but what about after that? We know this is going to last a while, and what are people going to do then?

People who've lost their jobs due to COVID-19 really need that help and support right now, and receiving $2,000/month for up to 4 months, at least to me seems a lot more helpful.

No,

The benefit will be available to workers:

Residing in Canada, who are at least 15 years old;

Who have stopped working because of COVID-19 or are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits;

Who had income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application; and

Who are or expect to be without employment or self-employment income for at least 14 consecutive days in the initial four-week period. For subsequent benefit periods, they expect to have no employment or self-employment income

Even if you still have your job, but had to stop working, you get the money. You don't have to lose your job to get it.

You also get $500 per week for 16 weeks. It's not a one time payment.

Unfiltered as well. Seems like anyone can apply and have some sweet cash in their bank account within 48 hours. I’m not sure how they are able to manage it but there could be long term problems if they can’t recollect the people who abused it.

There are some jobs that are hiring big time. If you are in Canada they are desperate for help in elder care facilities. Just cleaning floors and shit. And many jobs like food deliveries, couriers, grocery stores, pharmacies, corner stores, etc... are still hiring and desperate.

If $1200 is enough to float you for a month or two this will help you even more. And you are taking these jobs because you're desperate, it has nothing to do with your background. This is temporary and meant to help you ride it out till things get better.

You did very well. The only grammar improvements that I would suggest is the capitalization of the singular “I” and the sentence “people has started.” People is considered a plural word (even though it doesn’t end with an “s”) so the proper possessive adjective (I’m horrible with parts of speech labels so I hope that is correct.) would be “have” instead of “has”.

“Have” is a helping verb. Subject-verb agreement is what you are talking about. People = plural subject. have started = plural verb. You know the right words, just not the labels, as you said.

No. The virus attacks everyone. You have a higher risk of dying if you are elderly or are in poor health. This generally means people in poverty. But by no means does it mean if you young and well off are you not at some risk.

They’re lying to you about the 1% mortality rate

As of the time of writing this post there are 2,064,815 cases worldwide BUT we don’t yet know how those cases will end. Whether they will end in recovery or death. There have been 512,252 recovered and 137,078 deaths. That means the real death rate right now is 137,078/(512,252 + 137,078) = 137,078/649,330 = 21%

That's totally wrong .. the mortality rate is the number of death divided by the number of infected people

You do know not all places are reporting recoveries, right? So half those "active" cases could be recovered

Re-check how many a bad flu season kills—-we’ve still not caught seasonal flu deaths this year as a light season.

Do entire countries implement social distancing guidelines to help ease the seasonal flu??? Plus there is a vaccine, plus there is anti-viral medication. Your thoughts make zero sense. If we did nothing between 1 - 2 million US lives would have been lost.

We’ve lost tens of thousands of lives world-wide in the last month or so, and people are still comparing this to the flu.

What in the actual f***?

I know it isn’t “just a flu” and the rate of infection is far worse, but it is still interesting to compare with seasonal flu.

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html

CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included [...] 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza

C19 is just about there right now. So in practical terms the illness itself is comparable to seasonal flu.

However unlike flu it took significant lockdown measures with massive economic impact to limit the growth this much, and by the time we have driven it down to a low level the numbers will likely look worse.

Likely? They’ll be worse in a week. 2000 dying a day. We’ll be at 34,000 dead in 3-4 days. And that’s in 6 weeks, not 6 months like the flu.

2018-2019 flu season lasted from November to March, and was at above epidemic levels for 16 weeks. We don't have week-by-week estimates, but 32K deaths spread out across five months with a 16-week peak gives us at most 500 deaths per day on its worst day.

We've been at over 500 daily COVID deaths for weeks. We're currently at over 2,500. If you stretch that to the same time frame as the worst flu season in decades, we're looking at 300K+ deaths, 10 times worse.

Secondly, 34,200 deaths for that season is a statistical estimate, and the actual number of death certificates for that season with the flu as the cause of death is lower, per the CDC. The number of COVID deaths is conversely undercounted.

This will cause more panic and death than coronavirus. People would flip if they saw tanks rolling through their cities and towns. The South would become a hellscape.

There's very few people in the country that would do anything other than immediately obey. Don't underestimate the power of a normalcy bias, there's a great many people that believe that everything is going to return just as before in a few short weeks.

I don't see how logically anybody could look at the timeline of events of what has happened and think that any person in any substantial role of the government gives an inkling of a single shit about any common person and what we are dealing with.

This is not about democrat vs republican. This is about the fact that the government has shown to be unreliable and from here on I know that they are not to be relied on in cases of emergency.

They are inept.

The United States doesn't have a functional government anymore, it merely is the product of regulatory capture by the corporations. This is the same shareholder focus less than four year planning cycle that plagues corporations.

The president openly said he doesn't believe in the constitution and doesn't think it applies to him. And the only people who said anything at all were told to shut up about it. Nobody is willing to stand up for shit.

If you think the average American is going to take up arms against the national guard....you're living in a fantasy. This isn't a movie. 99% of Americans will shit themselves and go into the fetal position the second the first shot is fired.

Care to elaborate? Not really providing a discussion if you don’t at least explain why you feel that way. You’re just going to get downvoted, and you might have legitimate talking points.

Lockdowns are a short term solution that governments are going to apply long term. There's no vaccine coming. You can't vaccinate against coronaviruses. Our only option is live with it. Let's start now.

I get it, he's out of work and pissed at the lockdowns. A lot of people are. I'm pissed because of the lockdowns in my area (And I'm still going to work).

And I get some people completely exaggerate this thing out of proportion - This is just in the opposite direction.

Has anyone heard of George web in YouTube ? He says fauci almost got fired for illegal bio lab testing but bush saved him...is the virus SARS 2.0? To the chat bots and snowflakes downvoting me;

do some research. Fauci was reportedly was told to stop his research in america because things where getting dangerous..so fauci continued his research somewhere else thus bypassing his orders... because of his illegal tracking , he was almost fired but saved by dubya bush... look it up and look up George web on YT instead of being gay or programmed to troll.
