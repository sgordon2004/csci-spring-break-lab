Has anyone had any luck on the IRS website actually obtaining their stimulus payment status? My fiance and I both have had no luck and get instantly sent to an error message of "Payment Status Not Available" and we've not received anything in our accounts.

At the risk of sounding like an idiot at the surface level, I want to ask..

At what point does a pandemic that only has a .000003% fatality rate, causing social distance... become "Hey I'm at risk, I'll just be smart enough self isolate myself" while the world/economy slowly opens back up.

I know it may say sound insensitive, but does a fatality of below 1 percent of the world's population warrant tanking the world economy? At what point do say, wow 99.99997% of the world's population is and will be ultimately safe.

Taking into account that: We already seeing mental health problems spike, unemployment numbers spike (which causes loss of income, benefits, and ultimately health).



Would like to hear people's thoughts on both sides.

Just because our efforts are working (fewer deaths) does not mean we shouldn't have taken steps.

Death tolls would be far higher if measures had not been taken.

However, now is the time to discuss plans to safely restart the planet. We can't stay indoors for ever.

I am really pissed off here. My income level is below poverty level guidelines. I worked multiple jobs in my life, but currently am disabled and been receiving Social Security Disability for 10 years (after 10 years of receiving Social Security Disability, you would think the government could figure out what a person's income is?!?!?!?).

I spent $400 on food, since I get basically nothing for food stamps, and that just covered me for most of a month so I wouldn't have to go out for a few weeks. Also because of the nature of my disability, that includes respiratory problems, I'm in the very high risk group (which is why I bought the food ahead so I wouldn't have to go out).

I got no stimulus payment yet and can't even figure out why. When I tried the get my payment option on irs.gov, it tells you nothing. All it says is can't figure out if your are eligible or words like that, and this is very upsetting to me. And I got like $22 left in my bank at the moment, because of having to spend money I didn't have.

And right now, I have no idea when/if, I'll get the stimulus payment. And no way to figure it out, apparently.

Yes, it has locked me out.

All it states, from 6:30 AM in the morning was, something like unable to determine your eligibility. If you read this thread, other people had the same message pop up.

If you're on the IRS "Get My Payment" website, make sure not to use autofill and manually type all your info. The website won't recognize your autofill info.

This type of reply and thought hasn't made sense to me. Since when can the government force us to get vaccines? We don't force people to get the flu vaccine. 60,000 people died in 2017 from the flu and vaccines weren't forced.

Doesn't the additional 3700 uncounted NYC deaths start to make the IHME model look a bit low? I know everyone (including the whitehouse) loves that model but it seems to be miscounting recently. Seems we're still going up while it's saying we're past the peak.

Stimulus Check question:

I received an extra 1200 that was not owed to me. Has anyone seen this yet and if so what am I supposed to do with this? I don't need the money and would like to return it but am unsure how to do so.

Update: So I read this morning that recently deceased people are getting stimulus checks as well based on tax returns. My dad passed in 2018 and I filed his taxes in 2019 and those were direct deposited into my bank account so they had my information already. So that extra 1200 was meant for my dad. üò•

Contact the IRS. If they find out later it was sent to you incorrectly (and they will), they'll want it back, and with interest.

Question 1: has anyone been able to move countries during this time? Like if you had a work contract?

Question 2: what is the likely hood of European countries opening up less restrictive travel measures before September?

I was suppose to move from my resident country of Italy to Spain in June. However with both countries being hit really hard and having strict lockdown measures, I don‚Äôt know if moving for work would constitute as essential travel, especially since my work can be done remotely.

I can‚Äôt seem to find if any one has asked yet, but was there a cut off date to file 2019 US tax return in order to apply for the stimulus check? Background info: I was claimed as a dependent in 2018, and very recently filed as independent in 2019. Many people I know/work with have received their payments but I still have not seen anything. Thanks!

Related to US stimulus checks,

Maybe someone can help with this.... I‚Äôve looked on google and every gov website I can.

I filed in 2018, but since then both my address and bank account have changed, and my old address is a place that evicted literally everyone to sell the house so I can‚Äôt go back there.

Where is my stimulus check going to go?

(Before anyone asks, no my dumba** never filed a change of address with USPS until a few days ago, I just manually changed them with all my important accounts. Kicking myself for it now. And my old bank account was closed. )

The IRS has a place where you can update your bank information to receive direct deposit.

Edit: I see your dad claimed you as a dependent so you won‚Äôt receive a check but for anyone else who has this question about wanting to give new banking information!

Not tax fraud, I was actually a dependent. He was helping support me while I got my education, hence why he got to claim me, the money I made as a student assistant wasn‚Äôt enough to file. How is that fraud to you ??

Nope. Neither one of you will get anything for you cause you aren't eligible. You may be eligible to claim 1200 as a tax credit when you file your 2020 taxes but you are not eligible to receive a stimlus check.

I'm looking for a good source for all non asymptomatic deaths caused by Corona virus. I know that what the CDC reports includes asymptomatic deaths but I'm looking for non asymptomatic deaths. Any helps would be appreciated.

Edit: looking for source showing covid deaths with comorbidities. i found one for new york. im looking for a US in whole data source though. Thank you https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n

Just in case this was serious, you don¬¥t die because you have virus, you die because what the virus is doing in your body. If you don¬¥t show symptoms is because the virus is not attacking your body, so you won¬¥t die.

I would argue that you die becuase your body failed to combat the effects of the virus, not just what the virus is doing. Now if you test positive and die in the hospital but you are asymptomatic, that is still counted as a covid death. Im looking for data that shows deaths with comorbidities

you could be positive and die from heart attack, and perhaps they will count you, fine, whatever. But this doesn¬¥t mean you died because of the virus. Is like if you are AIDs positive and have a car accident and die, you didn¬¥t die for the virus, right? We live with all kind of virus everyday in most places and people don¬¥t die for no reason. Stay safe!

I understand that. That's why I'm looking for a source showing death BY covid, not death WITH covid. I've found a few sources per county or per state, but nothing for the US in whole.

OK sorry. The virus causes pneumonia and people stop breathing. That¬¥s the main cause of death if you call it like that. So I think all the deaths you see on the official counts are by covid, mostly because tested people are in hospitals and so on.

Asymptomatic, they would not have any symptoms. They would not die, they wouldn't even know they had it. Therefore they wouldn't be counted.

Meaning little or no symptoms, meaning they died with covid but was not the main cause of death. They would be counted IF they tested positive.

The CCP puts Muslims in internment camps, fact. The CCP is a surveillance state (worse than the United States by far) fact, the Great Leap Forward killed millions, Tiananmen Square, brutal crackdown on Hong Kong, need I go on?

People can dislike a government and like the people. I genuinely like the Chinese people but I don‚Äôt believe in their government.

I'm 15, live in Quebec and they're talking about going back to school. I think it is a very bad idea. Here's my list of reasons:

1- School bus. I take it, and there is absolutely no way to keep 2 meters apart in them.

2- Why? Why even go back to school? Our final exams were cancelled, our year is technically finished. I can assure you a lot of students won't work or will skip class if there are no exams.

3-COVID-19 has killed teens. Even if it's highly unlikely, there is still a chance. I'm especially thinking about students with asthma.

4-What about teachers and "guards" (Don't know how to call them in English, but they just watch students during lunch and break times) ? The "guards" are almost all old, and some teachers are too. If they catch it they could die from it.

5- What about students who live with their grandparents or have old parents?

6- We can't keep 2 meters away from each other in class. It is impossible.

7- Schools will be disgusting and will need to be cleaned before we can go back. A lot of students still have their lunchbox in their lockers because the schools closed so suddenly. Some of them containing perishable food and drinks. It will smell very bad and they will need to clean the lockers.

8- If we (students) get infected, then come back home and infect our parents, they will have to stay home and not go to work, and if they worked an essential job (healthcare, elderly care, police, grocery worker, etc) that's one less person able to help.

Overall I don't think we should go back to school as it is a bad idea.

that¬¥s the main concern about all this, that young people/kids can be infection vectors to their families. Plus, kids or teenagers are hard to persuade to use protection measures "right". Not you, but how are you gonna be able to tell a 6 years old kid to use mask and gloves? I mean xD

Still, if they re-open schools, is because they believe the situation is somewhat undercontrol... right? Take care!

Hi there! I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will get to this question or not, seeing as there‚Äôs already 3k+ on here. I was wondering if anyone knows, roughly, when this quarantine is coming to an end? Or when vaccines for COVID-19, are going to be available?

AITA?

I am (F, 25) living with my boyfriend (M, 26). I have been laid off since January and started working again mid March. Then all this virus stuff started happening. I live about 25 mins away and haven't visited my dad for about a month. He has a girlfriend that lives about 40 mins away from him and he goes there on the weekends still even though he clearly should not be. His girlfriend has a young daughter (17) and two twin boys (13). She has the daughter staying with her and the boys at their dad's house close by for a couple of weeks. My dad is an essential worker but works in a portable alone mostly. I am in my house pretty much all the time except that I live with two essential workers that again are lucky to be mostly alone while working.

Over the Easter weekend as my dad was away I was feeling incredibly over whelmed. My boyfriend is mostly behaving like nothing is different and yet my whole world feels upside down. I wanted to escape and get out to my dad's and have a night to myself to relax. Without even asking me what's going on his response was "no, I don't really want you too" - I said but you're seeing more people than me - I don't understand why I can't go into an empty house - his response made 0 sense and he was like "oh yeah exactly!" So I guess he was then worried about my risk?

Should parents really be making their children feel this way? I have seen so many kids telling their parents no you can't come visit - yet I can't get my dad to let me spend the night in his empty home? Please tell me if I am being an asshole here.

There is more to our relationship that makes it quite complex but I feel this is still bullshit lol.

TL;DR: Most carriers of the virus is asymptomatic but contagious and the virus can survive on surfaces for a long time. Don‚Äôt risk people‚Äôs lives.

I know it‚Äôs a hard time, but a better way to look at it might be this:

Pretend that either you have it and others don‚Äôt or everyone else have it and you don‚Äôt.

As in, assume that either you will give it to someone else or someone else will give it to you at any given interaction.

I know it sounds ridiculous that even though your dad sees more people and the house will be empty that night, but considering that the virus stays alive on surfaces for a very long time, either:

Since your dad sees so many people, the virus is in the house and you, an uninfected person, could get infected there.

Or

2. Since you might have it, you could give cough/sneeze/touch on any surface and accidentally give it to your dad.

I personally travelled internationally to get home before my country locked down 3-4 weeks ago. I shut myself in my room and stayed there for a full two weeks. My mother isn‚Äôt quite 60 yet but I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances. Mental breakdowns? Yep. Am I satisfied that no one got sick because of me? Yep.

I would like to do as much as I can to help in the UK.

I will be (initially) receiving 1K hand sanitisers by the end of the week. Where can I donate these?

I am also receiving sample test kits by the end of the week, for at home testing. If these are quality assured, I would also like to order a batch and donate these.

Any help would be appreciated.

With the current Covid-19 crisis a lot of people are hoping that public opinion towards things like universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage, better wages for teachers, taxes on the 1%, etc. will change. Has living through the Pandemic changed your political opinions on anything? Why or why not?

Those were things I was already for. Do I think anything will change? Not a chance. People have been adamantly voting against their own self interest for decades. They're afraid of words, people who don't look like them, people who don't think like them, and they think that everything is a zero sum game that they're terrified to lose.

There will be plenty of time after the pandemic is over. Right now most countries are still trying to figure out how to handle this pandemic.

However I have seen news outlets like Sky in Australia and even some reports on MSNBC about China's fault in this, so we'll definitely be hearing more.

I'm personally waiting for the documentary on Netflix in a few years.

The IHME model was updating their projection daily after they dropped their total deaths projection in the US to 60K. They bumped it up to 69K since and haven't updated it in the last 3 days. I'm sorry but this model is becoming a joke. Doesn't help they're taking China's curve and data and applying it to all countries when it's been shown China's data is inaccurate.

From the IHME project study.

"This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months"

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752v1

I know you read the article about fitting China's curve to other locations but it's pretty misleading.

The IHME model is doing pretty well, just because people say aha! It predicted x when y happened one day doesn't mean much.

i don¬¥t really know why is so popular in this forum. I find it much more interesting for you over there in US to look at Europeans to see how this thing will be there. Take care!

I have a question about the stimulus check (although i dont know if I'll get an answer).

If i filed my 2019 taxes and said that nobody could claim me on their taxes for 2019, but my mom filed her 2018 taxes (not 2019 yet) and claimed me as a dependent. Will I still get a stim check? Im in Chicago if it helps.

I'm 21 and my mom got hers, a coworker of mine got hers, but I didn't get one yet and I dont know if I'm gonna get one. I'm just kinda panicking bc I've been on UI for a month and haven't gotten a dime yet and I've been $-37 for like ever because a bill I scheduled a payment for took money out of my account before my scheduled payment date and I got an overdraft fee and the bank won't take it off. My landlord has zero plans to accomodate his tenants through the pandemic, my bills are still due, I have a cat to feed and I can't go back to work because I have rly bad pneumonia and an order to isolate until my fever is gone for a few days. Everyone told me I should be eligible for the stim check and I was kinda banking on it but I'm starting to think I might just get to go f*** myself about money until UI kicks in :(

More than likely your mom will get an extra $500 for having you as a dependent in 2018 and you‚Äôll see nothing. I‚Äôm not a tax accountant so don‚Äôt hold me to this. I would contact a tax professional and just ask the question.

You only get that $500 if the dependent is under 16.

I have my wife and 3 kids, we received a random deposit of $1900. That's fine obviously but it doesn't reflect the information given nor what our tax returns will be, which we have been waiting over 2 months for now.

Reports suggesting we may need to wait until 2022 to keep social distancing without vaccine, does this imply families cannot see each other until 2022?

Well if you and a family member both didn't have any contact with anyone for 14 days, in theory neither of you have been exposed and should not be infected.

By 2022 we should have antibody tests to show if you're "immune" or not. Though we really don't know how long immunity lasts or even if everyone becomes immune after recovering.

Question.

4 weeks ago my girlfriend had a mild fever and couldn't smell properly. A week later she got tested for coronavirus and was positive. A week after that the doctors said because her symptoms are gone - she doesn't have to self isolate anymore.

I'm currently not living with her but she wants to move in with me and I don't know what to do...

Despite those 72h CDC say, studies shown that patients already feeling good and with no symptoms could still be positive up to 12-14 days. So just in case, tell her to be careful at least couple of weeks - in this time frame you posted, another week or so?- for others (you in this case or any other). Take care!

If she's recovered and her fever has been gone for at least 3 days, it is rare for her to get it again and she should be safe to live with. Just remember that just like you, she can still touch an infected doorknob and then shake your hand, but as long as you both are washing hands and doing your best to not touch public surfaces, she should be totally safe to live with. There's no reason to fear people who have been sick or are sick. Yes you should avoid obviously sick people, but no you don't need to be afraid of them or of people who used to be sick like your girlfriend. If she's recovered from the rona, she can kiss you and cough in your face and as long as she hasn't done mouth things with an infected person, she is very unlikely to get you sick.

"Sure honey you can move in with me, but don't you think we should wait until the lockdown is over so we can get you boxes and a truck without worrying about a curve to flatten?"

Atleast 72 hours after symptoms are gone AND atleast a week since the symptoms first started. That is considered safe by the CDC (USA). SO if you also do a 14 day self isolation with the two of you, you should be ok.

I'm definitely in the minority in this sub, but I think I'm in the majority of the real world. I am not staying in my house past May 31st.

I'm willing to stay inside way longer than I'm comfortable with, but that's my deadline.

I know the consensus here is to listen to the health experts period, but if it were up to them, we'd be in quarantine until everyone is vaccinated. That's simply not realistic. Economics aside, this is awful for us as a species, as we are very social creatures.

The health experts want us inside for a year and the president want us outside tomorrow. The governors are our middlemen and they're the people that I'm relying on.

I would honestly be cool with extended unemployment or something for those of you who want to stay inside, even if it meant I brought home a smaller paycheck every week for a year, but I can't do it.

I can categorically state that you are not in the majority in wanting to break isolation end of May. Polling show majority does not want to go out until it‚Äôs deemed safe.

However, depending on where you life, it‚Äôs not impossible to imagine that some restrictions will be lifted by end of May. Other places... we‚Äôll have to see as most of central US is still not at their peak.

I could probably do this indefinitely but I can see why a lot of people are not so able to tolerate it.

I think it‚Äôs going to depend on driving the infection count down into the realm where tracking works. At the moment the numbers seem way too high for it to be an effective tool in many places. But it may soon work in others.

In New York the new case count is about 7,500 a day. Tracking down everyone all those people had contact with in the previous two weeks as going to be both difficult and also generate a huge quarantine list.

In Washington state it‚Äôs down to about 100 new cases per day. That‚Äôs a lot more manageable and may not generate a crazy number of quarantines. Once it‚Äôs down to about 10 per day it should be much more practical.

If you go down to county level it may already be reasonable to get tracing in place and relax the lockdown. I‚Äôm guessing eastern Washington state is probably there already. Seattle not so much.

What you do next is more questionable. I have a feeling it might amount to no more than allowing visits between friends and family initially.

I would say I don't care what you people do, but I think it does sort of screw the rest of us over because if the majority of people run out there before it's safe, then the hospitals will get overwhelmed, then one day in October, someone self-isolating like me, will get a staph infection from a simple cat scratch, then I'll be either turned away from hospitals because they're swamped, or I'll catch COVID-19 while I'm treating my cat scratch. And that f***ing angers me and makes me hopeless.

Ok, but hopefully there‚Äôs more conclusive info at that time. It seems every day the contagious factor gets worse. Now you hear things like the virus can get on your shoes. Or you can‚Äôt go running or walking behind anyone. How are we supposed to live like that? And now I hear conflicting reports that you can get it more than once. I hope we have enough data. I just don‚Äôt want any of my family getting in a vent.

The irs.gov website has a button "Get My Payment" or something like that, when I click on it, it says that it can't determine my payment eligibility.

I am a disabled individual and been on Social Security Disability for about 10 years, and I even send in my 1040 to the IRS each year, even though I'm not required to pay. So why wouldn't they know my eligibility, I am very confused here.

I actually figured they would screw it up, that's actually what worries me. I expected it to happen.

Just trying to figure out when/if, I'll get my stimulus payment.

By the way, now it says I'm locked out, apparently I tried to connect too many times, or my information doesn't match my records.

I like how, it doesn't ask separately for your apartment #, when it asks for your street address.

So, I'm always taken back to the Lewis Black standup from 2009 when he was talking about the housing collapse. He said, "Uhhh I think we're f***ed." When I watch the news and see people climbing over each other to get unemployment in Florida all I can think about is that line.

The other memorable quote was, "You should expect from your leaders the same thing you expect from an experienced canoe guide. We're going down that fork in the river because if we go that way THERE'S A f***ING WATERFALL!!!"

Good luck folks! I think we're f***ed.

Okay, so I was beginning to teach myself how to code and then the pandemic started. Am I better off not spending time on it and using this lockdown to get some other skills? I imagine the IT market will be oversaturated with entry level programmers? I'm still workin from home now but have a lot of free time on my hands.

Trust me, I highly doubt anyone‚Äôs going to be learning how to code right now. There won‚Äôt be an over saturation of programmers, every company is looking for more of them. Keep learning and building projects! Worst case: you learn a new and useful skill, as well as gain some analytical thinking. Best case: you find a new career path that you enjoy.

I highly doubt tons of people are learning to code while laid off, it's something most people don't care about and it's somewhat difficult to learn on your own.

It's a very in demand job and will continue to be when all this blows over. Keep learning and have fun.

i mean.. isnt this the best time to do what you like to do especially while you are forced to be at home? if you really love to code, DO IT. im not familiar with the franchise so i cant tell you on the oversaturation, but even if your chances get a bit smaller, that is still the chance and if you can make you standout, your good to go there i guess :) good luck!

Find a target company, not a career. Someplace everyone raves about in your area. Great people, great benefits. Call their HR and ask them the best skills to learn to prepare yourself for the future. Don't ask for a job. Ask for an objective view.

The company I work for shared a post on Instagram about how much they care for their worker‚Äôs health. Yet, me and everyone that work there are misclassified as independent contractors so the company doesn‚Äôt provide us with any health care. They‚Äôve also reduced all of our hours, making it near impossible to pay for my own independent health care plan. Companies that are using coronavirus as a marketing tactic to make themselves look good are the worst kind of scum.

I've posted in here a few times about my cousin's 96 year old father with Coronavirus, and I want to thank you all for your thoughtful comments. He passed away on day 10 in his nursing home after being unresponsive the last couple days and many days of coughing, difficulty breathing, and maximum oxygen (and one day, day 5, when his fever dropped way down, he ate some food, and it looked like he was improving). He received the hydroxychloroquine cocktail on day 1 when he had a fever of 101 if anyone is curious about that. He remained in the nursing home where he could be comfortable. RIP Tony, he was a kind man, a veteran, and a good father

Former medical doctor here (currently not practicing), so just sharing an educated observation and perspective..

I've been seeing and hearing quite a few people say that they think they already had Coronavirus late last year or early this year, before we were aware of it. I bring this up because some of them are exhibiting risky behavior by taking unnecessary trips outside their home and not taking personal safety measures seriously because they think they are already immune... now, I have been social isolating and not leaving my home unless necessary, but I was also one of those people thinking that I already had been infected with the virus, having gotten REALLY sick over Christmas break with a terrible cough and shortness of breath. I am a relatively young and healthy person who rarely gets sick, and this really knocked me out for weeks, but eventually, I got better without needing intervention. I was secretly hopeful that as a result, I was now better protected.

Yesterday, I was randomly selected to participate as one of 1000 LA county residents to get tested for antibodies as part of a study to see how Coronavirus has affected different communities. It was a study that I had submitted for online a week or so ago, along with my husband, who was not selected. I was fairly convinced I would test positive for the antibodies... I tested NEGATIVE.

I just wanted to share this to show that just because you were extremely ill a few months before, does not mean that you have been exposed to it and survived. Please do not assume that you are immune to the virus and please continue to stay healthy and safe by social distancing, staying home and washing your hands.

Yeah that mindset upsets me. I have asthma and a cold makes me sick for weeks and causes shortness of breath and wheezing on exhale that lasts for months after I recover... so my roommates are convinced I had it and don't have to be careful for my sake. They're not worried about themselves because they're young and healthy - I'm the only "at risk" person and they think I already had it. Really I just had a cold.

You can shed more light on this: a study from Germany China shows some 6% of people didn't even develop enough antibodies from their first SARS-CoV-2 infection to prevent a second reinfection. So even if you were confirmed to have it and recovered, it's not a guarantee you won't get it again a second time, thus becoming contagious once again.

It wouldn‚Äôt be all that surprising. There are all kinds of vaccines that require boosters. I hope the 6% number is right or even high. We can work with 6% losing immunity. If it‚Äôs a big number, hard decisions are going to have to be made about how to open the economy while sacrificing as few lives as possible.

Very interesting post and by interesting I mean sobering and eye opening. I presume this was a serological test for anitbodies? Have you heard anything about the reliability of the tests as I know there has been a lot of issues with the swab testing (too many false negatives)?

I agree with giving Americans money so that their lives don‚Äôt become hell, but how is it a stimulus when nobody is going to do anything other than pay bills or plop it right into their savings account? A stimulus check would be enough that all the bills are covered, some money goes into savings and there‚Äôs still money left over to buy things

It would seem to me that before we reopen the economy we should take time to allow our medical community time to prepare for the next round of infections by discussing best treatment methods what worked what didn't. Making sure they are fully stocked on PPE and supplies.

I do, and almost every public college and university in my area is planning for a full in-person return in the fall. The college I work at already has contingency plans in place to allow for summer classes starting in late June to be in person if conditions allow. I still expect all summer classes will remain online, but as of right now fall in-person is a go.

I am living in Vietnam and I am very proud of how they have handled the coronavirus outbreak here. Despite the first case being in January and despite being next-door to China, there have only been 265 cases and 0 deaths. As an English teacher here I haven‚Äôt worked since January and the government has been very strict on closing most things down.

I asked some of the Vietnamese locals and other expats living in Ho Chi Minh City how the coronavirus has affected their life and what they think of Vietnam‚Äôs response. If you are interested, here is the link to their responses.

You are correct. Flattening the curve doesn't mean we reduce the amount of people who are infected, it simply means that we spread the people infected out over a longer period of time. The lockdowns are in place now primarily because we needed time to ramp up testing abilities and also be able to prepare hospitals for handling this disease (obviously NY and a few others became overwhelmed prior to this). The lockdowns allow us time to assess the extent of the spread and the severity of the illnesses involved. It also provides more time to assess various treatment options, and gets us a little closer to developing a vaccine. However, it would require a very, very strict lockdown (lets say basically no essential services) for an extended period of time to have the virus die off completely.

So, the idea is to put in force shelter-in-place orders, get our arms around where the virus is, how big the problem is, how to test for it, and some of the treatment options/preventative measures that might work. Then you slowly let people resume normal activities, while still attempting to maintain routines like social distancing and hand washing, to keep the economy (also read mental health and well-being) from collapsing. However, this will mean that infections will continue, but, ideally, will not overwhelm healthcare providers.

Keep in mind that if we have increased testing capacity and they can roll out antibody tests, then we can more quickly identify and quarantine pockets of new infections.

Can anyone help me find a covid antibody testing center in Dallas Fort Worth area that still has availability for testing? Willing to drive father if I have to. Long story short I‚Äôm nearly positive I had covid, I am a nursing student who was doing clinicals at a hospital that‚Äôs been hit really hard before everything shut down and had close contact with a classmate that had just returned from NYC. I want to donate plasma if I was in fact positive, it‚Äôs been hard to sit back and watch from the sidelines. I want to help.

Update: found a location (arcpoint labs) but soonest availability was at end of May

My girlfriend's father was admitted to a hospital in Upstate New York the other day with kidney stones. I thought some people might think this is interesting, but the hospital was separated into two different sections for people who were COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative. Everyone who was admitted to the hospital was tested, regardless of symptoms. He said that the waiting room and other parts of the hospital for non COVID-19 patients were eerily empty with no one scheduled for any non-essential procedures and people trying to avoid hospitals in general.

Happy Tuesday everyone! If you are able, please consider supporting the food bank and other like organizations. They are in desperate need as demand has increased while donations have decreased. You can donate to the organization OR your local food bank. They accept food and monetary donations. Donate at: https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank

Coronavirus has resulted in an unprecedented need for food that the food banks are ill prepared for. In the meantime, food costs are increasing while food donations are decreasing. This pandemic is a tragedy but let us triumph in the darkness. More detailed info on the need can be found here: https://lettersontextualspaghettification.com/2020/04/13/foodbankaid/

Update: The only way the food bank can get the help it needs is if people spread the word and make those who can help aware of the issues. So please spread the word.

To add to this although food donations are accepted don't go buy food just to donate it. Monetary donations are better because the food bank has purchasing power and the food companies will generally give the food banks the best possible price. So they will get way more food for your money than you will.

That's a really good point, they also can then purchase what they need as I'm sure it changes day to day rather than getting a million cans of just beans or other highly donated items.

To everyone: from someone that now has to rely on their local food bank, we most definitely can use your support more now than ever. Lines are at least 3 times longer this week and they have less to give out. If you can't financially support your local food bank, please spread the word to others. Thank you!

I live in Switzerland and the curve is finally stating to flatten (I hope!)

We have not been in a full lockdown, however I do believe that people took all measures very seriously from when these were implemented.

Today we had 273 cases, which has steadily been declining since the 20th of March - at 1400 cases / day. Also our active cases have gone from over 14,000, to under 11,000. Whilst deaths are still high (yesterday we had 70 which was near the highest we've had in a day), they do lag quite some days behind cases. Hopefully they'll begin to come down, too.

I really hope things keep declining and that the cautious optimism I have can continue :)

I‚Äôm in TN. People here are out and about like nothing is going on. I wear my mask and get out 1x a week or less. I have 4 kids at home and they are eating a LOT! Governor has extended our stay at home order until April 30 as if anyone cares or is following. Only business deemed non essential are closed but tons of traffic and in and out of stores. Wonder what it will look like this fall? More time at home with kids if we have another outbreak?

I'll be completely honest, I'll probably be willing to do things again the second I'm allowed to, unless the decision to reopen feels shockingly reckless.

I don't think going to a concert or a sporting event will even be an option for a while. Same with very crowded bars or clubs, which I never really liked anyway.

But like a restaurant with tables spaced apart or a store with a limited number of shoppers at a time? I'll be there with bells on.

Comfortable enough. We realize how serious this is, and we are doing what we're being asked to do, but we can't live at home forever, and we're not going to be scared to go back to normal.

At some point, everyone's catching this. My wife, my daughter and myself are not at any high risk if we happen to get sick, so we'll keep our distance somewhat, but if we're being told that it's ok to start going back out again, that's what we're going to do.

I think unfortunately for people like yourselves, your job will continue to be to stay away while a vaccine is worked on, or the rest of us catch this and develop a herd immunity.

Stay safe, friend!

Not everyone will catch it.

As more people do catch it the rate at which it spreads will slow considerably because the virus has a harder time finding new hosts that aren't immune.

As social distancing takes hold the virus has a hard time finding new hosts, slowing and regressing the spread of the virus and helping to isolate it to smaller areas. This is the plateau and decline that everyone pays attention to.

At the same time as all that we are working on vaccines which hopefully become available and finally severely diminish if not eradicate the virus.

Put all those together and it's entirely possible not to catch the virus at all.

Immediately. From the philosophical point of view this virus has made me realise that I value living an actual life far more than living in fear of death.

Same. I am socially distancing. Barely leaving my apartment except unless absolutely necessary. But sitting in an apartment and not interacting with anyone for months on end isn‚Äôt really a life worth living.

Like others have said, for some places it would be wayyy to early. But remember, New York alone has like half of all US deaths. Other parts of the country have been doing great.

Now, the real question is how these areas would handle the inevitable second wave as they reopen. We will see

I have a strong suspicion that states like NY with on demand/drive up testing have a much better handle on the size of their outbreak and states like Ohio are suffering from a much larger undercount than most officials imagine. [edit spelling/grammar]

Taking husband to get tested today! Washington state, US. The process to actually get a test was a bit obnoxious. Called my primary yesterday, was sent to an automated covid questionnaire, qualified to talk to a real person questionnaire, then had to videocall with a doctor to be reccommend to get a test. It took about one afternoon and teating the following day. Unfortunately husband had NO idea his brains about to get poked.

Having to make the decision to start lifting these stay at home orders has got to be terrible. We'll never be completely ready until we have a mass produced vaccine but you can't keep businesses closed and people at home forever.

I think this is the right place for this: 3 days after lockdown started, I saw a large outdoor party a few blocks away from my house. I was returning home from quick trip to grocery and had to stop in street as partygoers were out in street. Drove home SMH at their idiocy. Today I find out there are 9 confirmed cases near party site. Maybe they thought it was a hoax. Edited: spelling.

There's no shopping service in my area. I'm a single mom with a two year old. My kid has a feeding disorder and a milk allergy, so his diet is specific. I don't have a choice but to take him with me to the grocery store every week. He won't wear a mask. He pulls off my mask.

I have no idea what to do to minimize his risk of getting sick.

Try reaching out through a neighborhood or town Facebook page, or the NextDoor app. Contact any food banks in your city or county. Reach out to churches and mosques, or other community service-oriented groups. There seem to be people everywhere willing to help, sounds as though you just need to do some work to find them. Good luck.

Edit: Also, if available, try ordering groceries online for pick up. (Walmart and many, many grocery stores)

In basically every r/COVID19 post people comment about the ‚Äúiceberg theory‚Äù that the death rate is actually extremely slow and most people are already infected without symptoms, which means lockdowns are unnecessarily destroying the economy. Many people calling for the lockdown to end and to instead isolate only the vulnerable, while letting the others get the virus to develop herd immunity. What do you think?

This is anecdotal, but I know 3 people who have all had very bad illnesses recently with the symptoms of covid-19. All of them recovered and none of them got tested. So that makes me feel like the number of cases in this country is being vastly underreported.

Is there any data on how mild symptoms can be when someone gets the virus? I was having pain in my lungs and some moderate trouble breathing for about a week and am now getting better, but I never had a fever or cough. As a healthy young person (23/M), is it possible to get the virus and experience such mild symptoms?

Yes it‚Äôs possible. Testing is still limited so unless you feel you need medical intervention there‚Äôs an 80% chance you‚Äôll recover on your own if we‚Äôre still using those percentages from early on. Feeling better I‚Äôd take as a good sign. I went through something similar.

A little pain and cough for 2 weeks, better now for 2 weeks. I never had shortness of breath.

My brother in high school was telling me he and his friends have been meeting up in parking lots, and they sit on their car trunks and just hang out and talk. Sounds like they leave at least 1-2 spaces between each car. I thought it was a fun idea, but a couple friends of mine think they‚Äôre being reckless and shouldn‚Äôt be violating the stay at home order like that. I feel like especially for high schoolers though, expecting them to not try to see their friends is probably a fool‚Äôs errand, so I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre trying to do it as responsibly as they can.

Can anyone explain why there seems to be a dip in the numbers, specifically for the US, every weekend?

If you look at the Daily New Cases and Daily New Deaths charts on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ you will see a clear upward trend, then around Sunday each week, a dip. Sunday 12 April, and yesterday, both show lower than expected numbers, if you follow a general trend line.

I suspect there's a drop in the number of tests processed or paperwork being done on weekends, but I don't have a source for that.

Edit: source

Did anybody else see the study on pregnant women in NYC? A hospital has been testing every single pregnant woman regardless of whether she has symptoms or not. A few big things came out of this:

A lot (1 in 8) tested positive.

88% (!!) of the positives had no symptoms. They were completely asymptomatic.

Now, pregnant women are not a representative sample of the population. They‚Äôre younger and healthier on average, and they‚Äôre female.

And it‚Äôs possible more could develop symptoms later as the disease progresses. (Edit: per the study 10% did subsequently develop fevers)

But, if this study is an accurate picture, it means (a) coronavirus is much more widespread than the official numbers indicate and (b) it‚Äôs far less lethal than initially feared. The number of deaths we‚Äôre seeing is just a result of the sheer number of infected, but the disease itself is just a bad flu essentially.

This actually jives with some of the data out of Germany (where one study found a fatality rate under .4%) and the cruise ship data.

Stay safe everyone...

I said this earlier on a post but I'll say it again.... Them saying the women were asymptomatic without follow-up is essentially meaningless at least in my opinion. Giving birth in a hospital is a 2 day ordeal for uncomplicated vaginal birth, 4 days tops for a c-section. With that short of a window of observation you can't truly say. I wish they would follow up.

April 14 Updates

Incorporated April 13 data

Cumulative positive percentage (CPP) remained at 19.7%

Overall trend continues

The plateau in new cases per day (around 30,000) seems to be limited by how many tests are performed.

Simply put, if tests are limited to 150,000 with 20% positives a plateau is hit at 30,000 new cases a day.

The table below shows how this tracks with the last 15 days of US historical data on testing from https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily

The cumulative positive percentage (CPP) is calculated as the most recent Positive / Total Tests (576,774 / 2,935,006 = 19.7%).

Estimated Cases (Est Cases) is calculated as that day's New Tests x CPP.

The daily positive percentage (DPP) is calculated as that day's New Cases / New Tests and shows how consistently these two statistics are related.

This highlights the importance of widespread, large-scale testing. Without it:

New cases appear to plateau leading to a false sense of security

Deaths are undercounted due to undiagnosed cases

Projection models are less accurate (garbage in garbage out)

When do you think Highschool Students will return to School?

I was wondering if students from 11th and 12th grade will actually return to school (physically) in May or June. Or will it be only online classes around that time? I'm kinda stressed about it and I think everyone else is like me for obvious reasons. Thank you for your time. Stay safe y'all. Forgot to mention, schools in europe.

Please explain this to me, the reason for the shutdown is to help hospital's deal with the increasing demand. Ok , reasonable response. Then they say they want you to go back to work May first. Don't you think the hospitals will be overwhelmed with this virus?

At what point will these hospitals not be overwhelmed? Serious question. We are going to get to a point in which entire supply chains will collapse, basically ending the US economy. At this point 2000 people have lost their job for every single death from the virus. That is a lot of people that will be unable to afford food and housing.

that's why the smart people are saying science should decide not politics, or even better "we don't set a timeline, the virus sets a timeline"

CHILE COUNTS THOSE WHO DIED OF CORONAVIRUS AS RECOVERED BECAUSE THEY'RE 'NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS,' HEALTH MINISTER SAYS BY SOO KIM ON 4/14/20 AT 11:36 AM EDT

Cases of the novel coronavirus in Chile have climbed past 7,500, including 82 deaths, while over 2,300 have recovered from infection as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

But coronavirus patients in Chile who have died are being counted among the country's recovered population because they are "no longer contagious," Chile's Health Minister Jaime Ma√±alich said this week.

yeah I see a surprising amount of people on my city's FB feed like that. You look at their profiles and it's just Sam Eliot memes about America and obvious fake pictures/videos of nurses and doctors dancing because they think covid is fake too.

Something isn't adding up for me. Today New York added over 50% more deaths. I recall that their peak deaths were 799, which stuck in my head. Now I look at this chart with the new deaths added (page 3) and with the 50% bump the peak day is still slightly less than 800 on the bar graph.

https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-confirmed-probable-daily-04142020.pdf

So am I loopy? Because 50% more than 800 is 1,200.

IMHO the president abdicated his responsibility when he didn't shut down the country earlier, various governors abdicated their responsibility when they didn't shut down their states and left it up to mayors to figure out. whoever shuts it down decides when to open it.

Well this morning, literally within minutes of each other, my (recently unemployed due to shut downs) father and a friend send me to two separate videos from anti-vaxxers who are claiming all this is some governmental scheme to gain control over our lives. One was an Instagram model, and another was some radical right wing Indian PhD running for senate in MA.

What is happening in this world? When did science and medical professionals become the big, bad boogie monster to these people? For what it's worth, me and all my siblings have been vaccinated thankfully. Glad this pandemic didn't happen 30+ years ago, because chances are my parents might have not been so trusting.

There are a lot of wealthy special interest groups ramping up who want the economy to be the #1 and only priority. The easiest way to do that is to convince as much of the general public as possible that this isn't a big deal by spreading bullshit memes and such everywhere.

This subreddit was an interesting real-time demonstration of how reddit works at different scales. For a while it was a great source of information, that aggregated news very rapidly. Even up to say mid-March it was still okay even though the number of subscribers had started exploding. Now though, I find the top submissions useless more often than not, they stay at the top for too long, are often quite irrelevant and are equally often just repeats of the same information from previous days, or even weeks. Comments have devolved into a mess, with the typical reddit thing of just reacting to the title, people getting gold for "correcting" the consensus while blatantly lying, lots of complaints about the moderation, about bots, about everything.

tl;dr subreddits of this size are invariably dysfunctional, this place was a much better resource before it grew explosively

My boyfriend has been staying with me, ironically to get away from his sister who he thought was exposed to COVID in Florida. He caught the virus from work and has been with my family for a month. The most drastic symptom he had was a loss of taste and smell, and he has regained that for over a week. I was sneezy and lost my sense of taste and smell, and that has also been gone for over a week.

If we both had the virus, but have recovered, can my boyfriend go back to his house with his family? They have been quarantined and social distancing for a month as well, and have shown no symptoms. If he can go back, can I visit, or can I not visit him until the shutdown ends? I'm just looking for the best course of action, please don't yell at me.

I‚Äôve been living by myself in London for around 6 weeks during the lockdown. I‚Äôm able to WFH fine and have access to shops. My parents live out in the countryside, they want me to come stay with them during this (I guess they‚Äôre worried), but I‚Äôm unsure what the rules are. My dad has offered to come pick me up and drive me back to theirs. I‚Äôm getting to a point where I‚Äôm beginning to struggle with the isolation., I‚Äôm introverted but even I have my limits. Essentially the journey would be from my parents‚Äôs house to my flat, then back to there‚Äôs. Is this allowed under the current U.K. rules? Neither myself or my family have shown any symptoms.

When do you think social distancing is going to be lifted? In California we have it until May 3 but I have a hard time imagining the pandemic to be under control by then... so I expect they're going to extend it. Maybe it will be safe for things to start transitioning back to "normal" in July?

I truly can say this corona shit really ruined me.



Since late february, I was looking at cars to get and around the same time I finally decide what I want, COVID hits. I have not had a car in over 6 years, crazy right? So... I already had an appointment scheduled to get my expired license renewed. (expired a few months ago on my bday) and that was cancelled due to the crisis. I can't renew my license online as I did that last time, so I am required to go to a branch office. All branch offices seem to be closed as well. Cool.



I finally get around to file for un-employment, got to the part where I have to enter in my license. Now, since I dont have a valid license, it requires me to call to get a code to continue applying. Can't do that either as the phone lines will put you on hold for 4+ hours and sometimes the lines don't even work. EVERYTHING requires a valid license and knowing I can't renew mine because of this dumb shit that is going on, I am basically f***ed until it's all over with.



I have been self-employed for years now so I'm not even eligible to get a stimulus check as well. Anybody else get absolutely destroyed from this?



Stay safe!

Does population density affect how badly a country will be hit by coronavirus? I was looking at the death rate per 1 million of different countries and it seems the more densely populated countries like France, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium etc has a much higher death rate per 1 million then the less densely population countries like Denmark and Finland. I've also noticed a similar thing with the US. New York and New Jersey are densely populated and have a higher death rate per 1 million whereas some of the less densely populated states aren't that badly hit.

Since this virus causes such a high inflammatory response and cytokine storms are an issue (due to an overactive immune response), do we think people that have allergies (not necessarily seasonal allergies) are at higher risk for severe outcomes or do we think it doesn‚Äôt have a major effect either way? Or could it possibly temper the response since your immune system is already used to being in overdrive from an immune response that it wouldn‚Äôt overreact in the same way as someone who‚Äôs immune system doesn‚Äôt have to deal with allergic responses

No. Not soon.

My state has already closed schools through September.

We will know more about how long this will take when random sampling of antibodies tests is done to determine what % of the population has had the virus and is immune. To extinguish the virus we would need >82% immune through vaccine or recovered infection. Risk might be acceptable to open up large venues at 60% or so. Current estimates are all over the place. The range starts at about 0.4%, runs to 28% for the US overall. Manhattan might conceivably be in the post-Corona zone, or not. Minnesota definitely not.

I have a question for Americans regarding coronavirus and a particular comment Trump made......

Before I post the question I just want to point out that we (in my country) have 9 deaths so far and are pretty devastated with that figure.....the population in the US is 250million and so when Trump said losing 100,000-200,000 is acceptable and in fact shows he is doing a good job in comparison here, with our population of 5 million, would be our leader coming out and saying losing 2000-4000 is acceptable....and thats of your own citizens

What i can't comprehend is how your leader can say something like that - keep in mind he couldn't give a s*** whether that 100,000-200,000 includes your grandparents, your parents or even you - and people still defend him, think he's a good leader......maybe this is all just a political game and I'm the one out of touch with reality.......

Why do some people believe the virus is a global hoax and that the media provides fake numbers to us? I know media can lie many times. But how would someone coordinate the whole healthcare system around the globe to lie and hide the numbers? Why would you just believe the words of a conspiracy theorist or a random nurse who made a video on how they lie about things?

Imagine the coordination you need in order to make millions of people lie.

I think people just struggle with accepting that such a terrible thing is happening in our world, something almost no one alive has lived through before. Similar to Global Warming. It's a lot to accept and some people take the path of least resistance and believe any group appearing legitimate that would defend their world view.

Because for whatever reason, for about the last 5 years or so, an overwhelming number of people have just decided that they'd prefer to be stupid. They think they know best, they refuse to trust people who are literally experts in any particular topic and instead have placed their trust in overly dramatic idiots with youtube channels.

Honestly, this strong trend towards purposefully stupid has me far more worried than this pandemic does.

The single most important thing that the government could have done in January and February would have been effective testing. They botched this completely necessary step on multiple occasions by refusing tests from the WHO, rolling out faulty tests from the CDC, then the FDA was slow to approve the use of new tests by private laboratories as well as the CDC.

Once community spread was established in February, social distancing then should have been encouraged. Instead, the federal government actively discouraged social distancing.

Successful mitigation would have looked like countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwain, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, etc. who instituted early testing and were able to track where people get COVID-19 from and issue appropriate quarantine procedures to limit the spread of the virus.

The ideal mitigation is farther back. Last summer, don't fire the US CDC pandemic monitoring and response team that was embedded in China's public health system. That puts the world's top field epidemiologists physically in the Wuhan market epicenter in the first week of December.

I just got a boyfriend before all this. I miss hugging him, etc. I miss my school, I miss the resources I had there (food, freedom etc). I miss the things that make life worth living. And having school online is what bugs me the most. Of course I understand it‚Äôs the situation, but it is so mentally taxing. I don‚Äôt mean to have a pity party when some people actually have the virus and are dying, but for those of us who are being precautious, waiting inside gives me massive cabin fever :(

I have the most awful feeling that a lot of people are gonna start disobeying orders and breaking quarantine within the next 2-3 months. Unfortunately, this is prob gonna be a thing where people can only learn the hard way why we have quarantined to begin with. Many see this as some far off threat even though it's in many of their backyards so to speak. Maybe once everyone personally knows someone who died of the virus, or rather once it's too late, then they'll take the order seriously.

Does anyone have that text time line of trumps actions ending with "I take no responsibility"? .. or even a current timeline of his actions?

edit: found it in case anyone was wondering

January 14: WHO release a statement that there is potentially human-to-human transmission and that investigations are underway.

January 24: "It will all work out well."

January 30: "We have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment ‚Äî five. And those people are all recuperating successfully."

I don't work for, I am not affiliated with, nor am I being paid by any of these companies. I also think it's pathetic I have to say that. Either way, I was able to find a lot of stuff from Walmart online and I believe they have a way to notify you when stock comes back. Also, places like Staples, Office Depot, etc, seem to have stock more often than places you'd typically expect.

Also, when I went grocery shopping a week ago, I just took a peak at the cleaning aisle for fun and saw that it was stocked with disinfectant wipes. Like.. the only thing in the entire aisle. I grabbed 2 bottles and left. I forgot something and returned a few hours later, so I looked again. All gone. Gotta be fast and lucky I guess.

It looks like we're going to set a new record today by a decent margin- already at 2190 deaths in the US. The previous high was 2035. There's still several hours to go.

OK so I don't usually watch the actual press conferences because all he says is bullshit anyways, but is having a self promotional video in the middle of a press conference normal? There was a Rocky montage...

I‚Äôm a paramedic in a county of over 1 million people. I won‚Äôt say which but it‚Äôs a large west coast city with a lot of tourists. We‚Äôve noticed a decrease in the amount of patients being tested for fever, cough, etc despite coming from places with positive covid outbreaks. Staff says patients are coming back untested after fever is broken and they are ‚Äúrehydrated‚Äù with iv fluids.

Homeless population who is put up in hotels and motels are saying a similar thing. Despite coming in contact with positive people.

Hospitals are making it very difficult to have an employee tested (RN for example) and the local ambulances companies are making it difficult to get tested as well. It just seems that as call volume goes up why is the number of people being tested going down.

For example,

City is testing 50 patients a day but has a capability of testing up to 100. Now the number of patients brought in with symptoms is going up by 10 every day. But the number of testing seems to be going down by 5 every day.

Day 1: 50 patients with symptoms. 50 tests done. 50 tests remain.

Day 2: 60 patients with symptoms. 45 tests done. 55 tests remain.

Day 3: 70 patients with symptoms. 40 tests done. 60 tests remain.

Etc etc. now this is a very liberal state and probably like top 3 liberal cities in the US. I‚Äôm no tinfoil hat type of person but I feel like something isn‚Äôt adding up and our entire workforce of 500+ feels the same. So I feel like I don‚Äôt see how the current presidential administration could have an influence over this.

Thoughts?

I thought people may be interested in a video from Russia showing what's it like for a restaurant to reopen. They have the same restrictions we have, but Moscow is allowing the different regions to start making 'back to work' decisions. The hope is that if things go south, they can tighten up, but if things work out, they can continue to lift restrictions. I've been following this guy for about 4 years because pretty much all of my knowledge about how people lived Russia is from the Cold War years. He's also vloged his family trip to the US a few years ago; it was interesting to see the country through a Russian's eyes.

Quarantine is working for now.

In Poland (37 million) we test around 5k people daily, and access to the tests is very limited. Despite that we get around 200-300 new cases daily. Quarantine is mandatory for around two weeks now - and thank god, we are now looking at +4% new cases for the second day! Last time we had double digit growth was a week ago, at +13% cases.

All of this in a country that is not that wealthy yet. Covid will be stopped here.

Some of the preliminary tests from Denmark and I believe Ireland should bring some good news. They‚Äôre finding a 65 to 70:1 ration of reported cases and people with antibodies. Hard to know if that will apply here, but could mean that some places could be close, or even have herd immunity. Even if not, there should be a supply of plasma with the antibodies that at least anecdotally show promise in treatment.

Hang in there, atleast in the US most places are near the peak. Fauci said this will be a dark couple weeks, but the hour is darkest just before the dawn.

Dawn is not here yet, but it‚Äôs coming. We will not be in lockdown forever, we will slowly get back into society.

Anyone else in this situation? Quarantining at my parents and have apartment in a different state. Eventually that lease is going to run out in the summer (early July). My mom is probably in what would be the ~doomer~ contingent on here where she thinks her life is basically over. I hope to god that this is over then but I know there‚Äôs gonna be a fight about this. However eventually I‚Äôm going to need to drive down there to get my stuff. Brought up the idea and she started crying. I‚Äôm fine to wait for now but eventually she‚Äôs going to have to deal with it unless she‚Äôs willing to pay for all the stuff I would ‚Äúforfeit‚Äù plus whatever fee is associated with just not moving out of your apartment

Dumb question perhaps but we keep saying social distancing isn‚Äôt about eradicating the virus, which I get. But in theory if we did a China style lockdown for 2-4 weeks so this virus couldn‚Äôt spread, wouldn‚Äôt it be eradicated (assuming theoretically every country everywhere coordinated this simultaneously, which I know is highly improbable).

I can thankfully continue work from home (5th week in quarantine now) so my day is not much different from a "normal" work day. The only difference is that I'm using my lunch break for jogging now (1 hr for 5 days in a row since quarantine week 1) and therefor work more efficiently on my current weight loss. Also I cook fresh everyday now. Overall I'd say these are probably the healthiest 5 weeks of my life so far lol

I use this time for 150% selfcare in every way.

Even though testing in Bulgaria is near to none, we legit have 20-30 people getting sick linearly every day.

And even though that's generally a good thing and they contained it surprisingly well, by the time we get herd immunity here (70+% getting antibodies) the economy will be impossible to dig up.

I really don't know what to think.

Hopefully the higher deaths today are just a lagging count from the 1500 deaths yesterday. But if we still see 2100+ deaths tomorrow, that's not good at all...

Its all about that 3 day average. If the number of new cases continues to flatten or decrease though that should lead to less deaths in the future.

My upper chest has recently started to feel funny like I just took a hit of an inhaler. I'm not worried but I do want to be cautious, especially extra cautious when it comes to picking up groceries versus having them delivered and to help do whatever I can to prevent spread. If I haven't developed any other symptoms like a cough or fever, is it unlikely that I would have chest tightness first?

I‚Äôve felt a certain blanket heaviness in my lungs for the past 5 days or so, it‚Äôs not getting worse or going away. I first noticed it when i cycled my indoor trainer, last week did 50km no problem, this week in the first 5 km I felt like I had run a mile outside in cold January weather and my breath felt ragged.

I‚Äôve ordered an blood oxygen meter in the mail so I can keep track of how my blood is oxygenating, but also want to wait until I have more pronounced symptoms before I go get tested.

Also have asthma so that‚Äôs a worry of mine. Hope it is just stress and anxiety

So on the 23rd of March I started getting chest tightness too which was my first symptom. On the 28th of March the flu like symptoms kicked in for me. I don't know if it was Covid-19 I caught but I'm still recovering from whatever I caught 3 weeks ago. Every 3-4 days the chest tightness will comeback, trigger 1 hour of coughing, i'll bring up some phlegm and then the chest tightness will disappear again for another 3-4 days.

Is there a data model that shows the curve and long term impact with date variables of "opening the economy back up"? I have been looking for information that would show the impact of reducing the restrictions over time, so you could slide dates by state and see how hospitalization, ICU and incubator needs increase or decrease. I know there is potentially the lack of underlying data, but I think it would be helpful to make an assessment of the decisions that governors might make. Something like the IHME charts.

The error bars on their "prediction" for today runs from 464 to 7,084. And narrows as time goes on.

Prediction doesn't work that way. The farther in the future an event occurs, the more opportunity there is for changes to occur.

Banks would be first in line to grab the payments to offset a delinquent loan or past-due fees. Even if the individual thinks their account with that bank is closed, if the payments post there, the bank could conceivably use them to cover old debts.

Simple solution: don't send your stimulus check to a bank you owe a debt to.

I guess I could see some banks taking advantage of this, but at some point businesses have to realize that the endgame of finding every possible way to screw over their customers is going to 0. Banking is a competitive market, people usually have the option to switch if their current bank has a really bad reputation.

The number of deaths isn't so strange. You can't really compare new cases to deaths on any single day, but it's still unusual to see this many less new cases reported but yet more deaths.

It has been amply pointed out that the cases confirmed per day is driven mostly by the tests conducted per day. What % of the population is infected overall or in each locale is unknown. That will be determined by random sampling for antibodies, which is not yet done.

It shows our failure to prepare that we don't have established surveillance or tracking of epidemics or even deaths at this late date. We just let it happen. In an information based society where you can get same day delivery of common goods ordered on your mobile phone from anywhere, where real time traffic monitoring can route you dynamically in real time through a city based on how many mobile phones stall in motion on the road, we wait years for reports of how many died of what cause.

The only curve that matters is new cases, new hospitalizations. New deaths only tells you about how the infections were spreading 7-10 days ago.

The rate of new infections is at a plateau rather than the hockey stick we saw a few weeks ago.

Flattening the curve is easy to do when you stop testing. Where I live, the local hospital published the following...

‚ÄúLehigh Valley Health Network will now only be testing certain people for COVID-19 amid shortages of test kits and other testing supplies, LVHN said in a news release.

The new criteria have been implemented at all Assess and Test Centers throughout the LVHN network.

Under the new criteria, only symptomatic people ages 65 and over, symptomatic people at a higher risk of complications and other defined symptomatic at-risk people will be tested for COVID-19, LVHN said.‚Äù

Of course, since this update our new cases have started decline. But deaths are up. Hmm.

I know the death tally here in the US isn‚Äôt exactly something to go home and brag about,but why are we comparing these infection and death numbers on a raw basis to countries like Spain and Italy. Per capita Spain and Italy have a death rate 6x higher than the US. Furthermore, New York accounts for like half of US deaths.

I guess my point is that it really isn‚Äôt fair to make broad generalizations about how the US is handling the coronavirus in the first place, since we are such a large country with many different populations and demographics, and coronavirus decisions such as stay at home orders have mostly been made at the state level, not the federal level

Watching Gov. Newsom lay out going forward in California. The opening of any state not run by a republican is going to depend on testing.

We need more testing.

Proud we locked down to protect all Californians.

Local health officials will be in the loop determined to cater to their specific needs.

California is not going to fight the feds, we are going to open our state when health officials determine it is time, not when an inept president wants to.

Stay strong, stay safe, stay home.

Since people here have to be hospitalized to get tested, it‚Äôs definitely more than 80,000. A friend of mine was sick last month and had a lingering cough, then got sick again with a fever and went to the dr. He told her she didn‚Äôt qualify for a test (she has a fever, cough) and that if she had corona, she wouldn‚Äôt have a cough for a month. So there‚Äôs that.

You don‚Äôt need a sinister agent to do that. All you need is enough stupid and impatient government leaders. This thing isn‚Äôt gone. It‚Äôs only plateaued. If governors get impatient, we‚Äôre right back where we started.

I remember the anthrax fears after 9/11. It turned out anthrax spores do not aerosolize unless they are very carefully grown and incubated. This virus could break out again, but it takes some skill to grow it. You have to grow cells with specific receptors. You have to know how to keep them healthy and not contaminated with something else. You have to have some kind of safety equipment to be sure to not infect yourself in the process. You have to make sure your virus doesn‚Äôt die in transport. Then you have to sprinkle it on a surface where it will survive multiple touches by people. There are a variety of other issues.

I like how no one is mentioning that the IHME model increased their US projection to show 69K deaths now.

I'm in Illinois and they went from projecting 766 total deaths a few days ago to 1248 today.

Edit:

Maybe I should have specified: when the model dropped from 100K to 60K, everyone got excited and was throwing the model around as fact. But when the model goes up in deaths, people dismiss it like some of these replies are.

Wish people would just pick one or the other.

Because the realities of data change their model that's how it works. But the politicizing of this has gone to the extreme. I personally believe that model is going to revise itself upwards as soon as any sort of relaxations towards opening the economy, plus Easter if 14 days for now we see an increase in cases Nationwide.

As far as the accepting and discounting on the model, that's as old as apple pie. People will flip flop as it supports or contradicts their on viewpoints.

These models are subject to change wildly as variables change. IMO they are an excellent resource to educate leaders on the potential impact of measures on a macro level but are certain to be inaccurate at predicting final numbers of deaths.

If Covid-19 can only survive on surgical masks for up to 7 days, why can't we re-use the mask after a week has passed?

I read the coronavirus can survive on the surface of surgical masks for up to 7 days. If I have 10 masks, can I use one, then let the virus die then use it again in 10 days? Is there another safe way to disinfect the mask so I can re-use it?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, it's just a thought I had..

With today's deaths, about 0.1% of the total population of NYC has died of Covid-19, with over 75% of currently known cases still unresolved.

Hopefully this tragic death toll will finally put an end to the persistent claims that if only we tested enough people with antibody tests, we could somehow prove that Covid is no more lethal than seasonal flu.

I can't take it anymore. Being a friendless loner who works from home was my life for 4 years before this. Things were changing and I felt blissful.

I'm forced back into it and I don't have the will to keep going. I'm immunocompromised so if I catch this I will likely die. Is it selfish to take my own life if I'm going to die anyway? I have very few friends and nothing left to look forward to. If I'm going to catch it anyway and be miserable until then, I want to die on my own terms.

Same here. I got a new job, and my anxiety was getting better. I know you feel like it's a huge draw back, and it's hard when you fall into those dark holes.

There is an exercise I do now to find that path i need, that light to keep fighting. What would you tell your 6 yo self if they were in front of you? You have the potential to be there for him/her and be there mentor. What would you do? What does your 6 yo self see the world as? Full of possibilities? It's up to you to lead them, hug them and tell them it will be ok.

Even though you don't feel it right now, you owe it to yourself to keep fighting. You're f***ing worth it.

<Virtual hug from someone who knows that fight>

The virus latches onto ACE2 receptors in your nasal passages/mouth before migrating to the intestines where a high concentration of ACE2 receptors in those cells allow it replicate quickly and use as a reservoir.

GI issues of mild diarrhea/loss of appetite would be the first symptoms that could be easily ignored and perceived as asymptomatic to the public. In the meantime, the virus is passing through your lymphatic (immune) then cardiovascular system to eventually colonize in your lungs as a secondary infection.

By the time people have noticeable symptoms of cough/pneumonia, the virus is already passing through the heart with the cytokine storm of debris (w/destroyed T cells) from the ravaged immune system along with it. That stresses the heart and increases the chance of fatal complications like a heart attack.

This makes alot of sense. No idea if it's related to me as I had one of those "weird" illnesses a few weeks back. My office shares a building with a doctors office and we shutdown to work from home a month ago. The following monday I caught something that knocked me on my ass for two days, chills, general flu symptoms, cough, and had the worst bowel movement issues for nearly a week and a half after that. Never had anything like that before, and I haven't had a fever or the flu in over 10 years.

Not saying I had it, but I'd love to take an antibody test.

Cant talk about this without major downvotes. People forget that regardless of who is paying for what (whether the cost is ultimately borne by governments, individuals, corporations, or some mixture), at the end of the day we have finite resources. We have to figure out if the price tag is worth it.

We need three things to get out of lockdown:

point of origin diagnostic testing. This means, local doctors able to test a patient for covid-19 and get results back quickly.

Quick and efficient serological testing. This means, the ability to see if someone has already had the disease and has antibodies for it. This helps prevent health care workers from being quarantined for no reason.

Efficient contact tracing of patients who test positive for covid-19. This way you can have people who have had contact with an infected person self-quarantine until they have been tested for the virus.

I'm amazed the US hasn't experienced looting yet. I visit Buffalo daily and even in the "poorer" neighbourhoods the population is staying indoors fwiw.

I'd be more concern for Red vs. Blue real life PvP, there is a lot of fresh iron floating around. My buddy is up in Maine and everyone is packing right now.

If your health system gets overwhelmed and people dropping dead all over the place it‚Äôs gonna hurt the economy too and over a longer period of time due to the uncertainty it will create. There is a balance to be struck on how much to restrict things but the key item to solve for is to ensure the level of transmission stays at a level that the health system can cope and keeps the mortality rate low. Different countries have better or worse health care systems and number of people sick, age profile etc so I suspect there isn‚Äôt a one size fits all.

My main issue is if lockdowns such as those in Italy simply stall the virus at its current rate rather than significantly lower the rate of new cases. Then you end up with an unsustainable lockdown and any easing will just rapidly overwhelm the health system again.

There is no such thing as placing health over the economy. People will not be healthy if they're trapped in their homes without in-person social interaction for very long. People will be even less healthy if the economy or supply chain collapses and they can't get food or medicines.

Based on what we know so far, economy experts believe that a lockdown is better for long term economy. It's not the lockdown that's killing the economy, it's the virus. Even in Sweden, business that are open have lost 80%-90% of their visits. People spend less money when they are afraid. If we open too soon the long term financial damage will probably be worse.

I do not believe the curve is flattening. We're not doing enough social distancing in the United States. We've all been shown these graphs of a hill that goes up, then plateaus. Or if looking at active cases, goes up to a peak then drops.

I think what we're actually having is a steady incline. Maybe this is what's desired, so hospitals have a chance to recover from lack of preparation and get themselves into a position to handle the upcoming numbers of people. But I don't believe for one second that this week or next week, or the week after that is going to be peak of anything.

We keep comparing our shelter in place "requests" to countries that have actually locked down. It's not the same thing. If we had of done an actual lockdown, maybe we could have fixed this but I think it's far too late and our health care system is far too behind.

I don't even understand how we can rely on the reported numbers when people are being refused testing. Incline/decline is only related to available tests and a doctor's willingness to do that test..

How can we use those numbers to determine when it's safe to go back to normal if we're just turning a blind eye to a whole other group of carriers...

Is it possible one of the main reasons western countries don't do the antibodies test more widely as a measurement of reopening, is because the fear of people trying to get infected so they can get back to work?

I think not enough people got "naturally" infected yet. And many still think it's like the flue. If government start to allow only people that already been sick to go back to work, many will try to get it.

I haven't seen a discussion about it yet. And I really believe it's one of the motivation for many countries hold back on using this test.

I think the main issue is having a test that doesn't accidentally pick up antibodies from other common coronaviruses and become false positives. Someone more knowledgeable can probably clarify but I really don't think it's more than a technical reason.

I think this is an inevitable risk..

I definitely know people who want to get that immunity card and go back to normalcy.

We did a significant disservice to folks by saying, "It's like the flu."

We really have very limited information about the novel virus including long term impacts to survivors and whether or not immunity works that way.

If we do have a second wave and that second wave can infect survivors and that second wave is deadlier, what we saw in NYC and Italy could be just a preview.

I hope it's not the case but I also think it makes sense to proceed cautiously. We shouldn't blindly run alongside cliffs.

Maybe a reluctance to say they‚Äôre fully recovered after reports of reinfection or reactivation. Are they putting out numbers for released from hospital?

I also feel like some US states have less information available like daily admissions. Do they just not have statiscians or is the news not helpful to their messaging. I‚Äôve been tempted to try to go back day to day to make my own graph searching for the peak.

I feel like I can handle not meeting my friends IRL for another couple of months, but a year or more is kinda mad. Luckily we have a small garden and some neighbours to chill with every now and then. Everyday when I go out for a walk, it feels like I'm in a no-go zone. 5-10 minutes to see 1 woman/man walking by with their dogs, shit was packed before even for a city not so big. I'm sure my mental health won't be affected, but sometimes you just want to sit and have a laugh with a friend.

I ask because I ask because Ohio (a state which requires a physician‚Äôs order for testing) is praised for squashing the curve. But I wonder if this actually represents an artificially low count due to gate keeping. (And for that matter uninsured and underinsured not having meaningful access.

The state of Texas is a mess across the board. Houston announced 2 days ago anyone could get a test, but the county is only testing up to 1k people a day at their test centers. You can get tested privately, but no idea if there's still back log with that.

Not likely at the moment. People have their skepticisms that this would be abused and wouldn‚Äôt go to the right people. I think by the time congress can figure out a plan most of the country will already be up and running again. Many essential companies have already propped up their own bonus plans to workers, and I think this bill would do a great job at helping workers/businesses out but I don‚Äôt think it will continue forward.

Any predictions on when the US will lift quarantine? All political leaders seem really eager to do it soon so I can't see it lasting past May 20th but we will see.

Anyone else have or know of symptoms like this? Thursday night I started to feel sick. upset stomach, chills and sweats, highest temperature reading was 99.5. Woke up Friday morning feeling totally fine, figured it was probably just a stomach bug from the greasy food I‚Äôd ordered on Thursday. Felt completely fine the next few days, until yesterday afternoon. I started to sweat out of nowhere while I was in a colder room. I lost my appetite soon after and my stomach began to hurt. I soon felt extremely fatigued as well. My temperature was 99.5 at the highest again. I forced myself to eat dinner but that made my stomach feel worse. I had a headache, chills and sweats for the rest of the night. After I went to sleep, I woke up four hours later with terrible sweats and chills. Couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep afterwards it was so bad. Today I‚Äôve just had a god awful headache, no appetite but less stomach problems when I did eat, and occasional sweats and chills. Still no fever (at about 99F) and no shortness of breath. Called my doctor a little bit ago and can‚Äôt get a test because no fever and not in an at risk group. I‚Äôm 23, in good physical shape, so the odds are on my side but it‚Äôs still scary. I‚Äôve been quarantining for almost a month now, other than walks/runs, and a grocery store trip last Friday, where I can almost guarantee that I caught it. Edit: not asking for advice in any way, just want to hear if people have experienced similar things

I feel like I have been getting mildly sick every couple days. Feverish, upset stomach, chest discomfort and indigestion, cough and runny nose.. then it goes away. Honestly, I am starting to think it might just be anxiety in my case. Maybe all the stress is wreaking havoc on my body. It‚Äôs also still possible to catch other illnesses besides COVID-19, and it‚Äôs allergy season.

The short answer is, you can't actually know. The results depend heavily on policy and travel patterns. You are gambling with a lot of sunk costs if you continue planning, and the safest thing is to cancel and plan for next year.

Question:

I will be venturing out into the world to run errands tomorrow for the first time in several weeks; the current recommendation for my city is face masks(covering the mouth and nose); but would it be worthwhile to wear some sort of eye protection as well? I haven't been able to find recommendations for civilians/non healthcare situations.

There are millions of people and entire cities and even island nations that depend almost entirely on activities which involve crowds, concerts, cruises, weddings, parties etc.

Given that none of this is happening in 2020, are there programs to keep funding and paying all the impacted people and businesses for this whole year?

I'm not taking about just the $600 check, but something to compensate for say, the lost income from cruise ships no longer coming to Alaska all summer, or the lost income to say, anyone who works in event management

I've heard about the apparent discoordination in the flow of information to state, local, and other health departments in the US. The CDC must send information to state & territorial public health departments before it can be sent on to local health departments. How are official communications made to tribal health organizations, labs, or other orgs that serve public health needs? In practice, what are the most concerning inefficiencies, and how can be fixed?

i think so, the death rate though is more accurate than the infection rate. presumably for every death there is 100 others who caught the virus that same day (about 3 weeks prior) with about ten days of a doubling time means current infections is 400x current deaths (not counting asymptomatic). as the doubling time lowers the hypothetical difference lowers too

Anyone who‚Äôs exercising outdoors wearing a mask while doing so?

We went for a walk for about 1.5 hours today and would like to make it a usual routine. We only saw a small handful of people hanging out in their porches/yards that were easily 6 feet away at least. We‚Äôd like to make this a part of our daily routine but I really don‚Äôt want to wear the masks I made, it would be too hot and uncomfortable to get any good amount of activity in with them on.

Of the few people we saw only one had a mask on, but he had a bag so I‚Äôm assuming he was walking back from the grocery store.

I also jog without a mask. I tried but it's just too difficult to get enough air to breathe. In my neck of the woods (South Bay in socal), if I go around 10am there's virtually no one out.

I also jog in the streets just to be certain I'm away from people on the sidewalk. There's not really any traffic whatsoever any more so that's worked for me so far.

Are there sidewalks on both sides of the street where you walk? If not, is traffic low enough such that you can walk down the center of the road if need be?

Masks are good to reduce risks from getting near people, but "not going near people" is much better. Personally I don't wear a mask unless I'm going to the store, but if I'm not going to the store, I can avoid coming within 18'+ of others...

The mask is not to protect you, just to stop viral spread. If you are indoors in an area where you can expel germs for other people to catch, yes wear a mask. If not, no need to wear unless you are trying to mitigate spread between the person you are walking with.

Hey can I get some replies on those who 0ppexperienced it? With how it felt while you had it?

I can't get tested. Hospitals are turning me away basically since I don't show all symptoms. The only symptoms I show is heavy breathing and a mild fever at 99.1 .

Edit: Alright my symptoms. I felt like I fell off a third story ladder. I had to concentrate on breathing for a few hours and very dizzy at times. I did not have massive fever. Besides the testing takes five days.

I'm asking this, because having other people's stories is nice. I know the symptoms, but it's clear each person's story is different. So I want to hear those who experienced it, and what they did.

I wasn't tested due to shortages since I'm 30.

I'm trying to understand the cytokine storm phenomenon. As I understand it, its when the immune system overreacts, and starts attacking organs and joints in response to the presence of the virus. The virus doesn't attack the lungs or the heart or the liver. The immune system does because it has become dysfunctional. Is this a similar thing to autoimmune disease?

Is this always present in all deaths from covid19 or just some? Is it relatively rare or relatively common? I've read that people sometimes die from the virus causing the heart to stop working. Are organs other than the lungs failing being the cause of death from covid 19 very common?

Sorry for all the questions.

NAD but from what I understand cytokine storm can be the cause of death sometimes especially in younger people. This is often the cause of death when younger people die from influenza as well. But I'm fairly sure from what I've read that the main cause of death with Covid is respiratory failure.

Exactly what I was thinking. I was overweight a year ago, living on soft drinks, junk food and sweets on a daily basis. Then it clicked and I changed my diet completely. I cut out sugar and alcohol completely, started exercising and by now I lost 26kg and have a healthy weight (the lower range of what is being considered normal for my height/age). My body absolutely hates it now when I drink a glass of wine or fall into a binge attack of sweets (which sadly happens every few months) but overall I feel so much better. My allergies are not as bad as they used to be and my Asthma improved drastically. You only have one body - living healthy pays off in much more aspects than only looking better.

It's time for most (all but the worst affected) areas to start easing out of the lockdowns before they're forced to take drastic measures and jump out of it.

The only point of the lockdowns was to ensure that hospitals don't end up overwhelmed. Outside of the worst hit areas, hasn't happened. Even in some of the worst hit areas, hasn't happened. Sweden, for example, still has hospitals perfectly free despite having a very soft lockdown and initial outbreaks in nursing homes. Better clinical practices, wearing cloth masks, and avoiding mass gatherings will prevent this from happening even more.

All the articles talking about "staying inside till a vaccine" are such incredible fear-mongering that I can't even say where to begin. But apart from that, they're also suggesting a literal impossibility.

Social distancing policies are a form of Non Medical Intervention (NMI). In this case they are the only effective means of controlling the rate of infection of a deadly disease to the point where medical services are not overwhelmed and can be helpful. Every pathogen is unique, and cultural habits such as frequently touching multiple people between hand washing (handshakes), casual conversation speaking distance, wearing masks, working while suffering minor cold symptoms, can influence reproduction a lot.

We have applied NMI such as closing schools and nonessential businesses, banning all gatherings of any sort, asking people to stay home short of essential needs. This is pretty much the whole basket of NMI. We didn't know when we did it whether people would comply, nor even with full compliance if they would be sufficient. In the places earliest and hardest hit compliance and effectiveness appears to be high enough to halt the exponential spread, but insufficient to drive active cases down to a managable level for a sustainable period of time. In areas hit late and so far lightly, NMI and compliance varies down to zero so those areas will continue to see exponential growth until the consequences of not using NMI become plain.

In places where NMI and compliance achieve manageable levels, some lightening of NMI methods can be fairly safely done. But to do it safely is not quick. If we didn't know the whole basket of NMI would work, we simply cannot know the effectiveness of individual elements and how they contribute. Lighten the wrong one too much and the epidemic spirals out of control - a fact that doesn't become plain until it has had two weeks to invisibly run amok. And then it would have to be brought back to a managable level before trying again.

Which restrictions to loosen, and when, and the best way to do that is thus a very complicated question. One that a lot of very smart people are working on right now. I believe in them, and us, to get it right. Having enough PPE for everyone to go about their business in an N95 mask and gloves would help a lot. Everyone has ramped production of those items and restored international trade in them, so we should start seeing that be available to all soon. When everyone you see outside your home is wearing a medical grade mask, we are almost where we need to be to get otherwise back to normal.

For vulnerable workers though, it's going to be a longer ride.

The answer to your question is in the very first line of my post: If you are over-cautious with opening up, you will find yourself in a situation where the populace forces you to open up far more than you ever wanted to which is the worst of all possible situations. You can try to close your eyes to this fact if you want, the fact remains that people will refuse to be locked up. We're already seeing it.

Also, it is never ever going to be feasible for anyone except healthcare workers to get sufficient N95 masks. That, again, is a literal impossibility. The general population will have to do with cloth masks for now.

People are going to do what they're going to do. If it kills someone, they go to prison. If it kills them, well, that's their privilege. People get killed jumping out of perfectly fine airplanes for fun.

What's not OK is employers demanding employees work unmasked in an atmosphere where unmasked people could be breathing out deadly virus. That's a workplace safety issue. There is no need to organize the work so that it is done unsafely for the worker. And if customer virus breath is a safety hazard for the other customers, requiring masks for service is just quality customer care. Sorry about your majestic beard dude, but if you won't at least put on this surgical mask you can't do business here.

As for availability, I have no trouble acquiring KN95 masks on Ali. Never did have trouble through this whole thing. They're functionally equivalent to US N95 masks, and now they come in a variety of styles at affordable prices. Healthcare workers might have had supply chain problems, but that was mostly bureaucratic red tape and administrative incompetence. Once the CDC approved contingency all the way down to homemade masks for healthcare workers when N95 supplies run out, which was early February, their Administrators should have grabbed a credit card and started thinking outside the box. Some did, and their people never ran out.

Bingo. If the crush on ICU beds isn't coming, we need to open up. The cases can still go up as long as the beds needed isnt more than the beds available. Last look at the stats that line was only crossed in NY and NJ briefly last week. Not in any other states and nowhere close in any of Canada

Here‚Äôs a different type of comment-

I am so sick of hearing ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù. It‚Äôs not like personally offensive phrase but it‚Äôs so meaningless, like we are literally not in this together at all, it‚Äôs not like people who say that are offering me a job.

I don‚Äôt know. The only reason 99% of us are at home is to help the 1% who will f***ing die from this. We‚Äôre not physically together, but we‚Äôre all in the same boat...sort of. Some of us are still getting a paycheck. Others are approaching panic mode. The feds can fix that problem. So far they‚Äôve chosen to take care of industry.

My state's unemployment office just posted this:

I am self-employed. Do I qualify under the new federal unemployment program?

Under regular unemployment rules, the incomes of self-employed workers, freelancers, and independent contractors are not subject to unemployment taxes and so typically these individuals are not eligible for unemployment benefits. The stimulus package creates a new, temporary program to help people who lose this type of work as a direct result of the current public health emergency. IDES will provide information about how to apply for this benefit as soon as it is finalized. Please do not apply at this time.

Thank you for waiting to apply until further details are available. This will allow our employees to address the large volume of claims for those individuals who are eligible under current benefit programs.

Alright I am freaking out a bit. Because I'm self employed, when I filed my taxes this year and last I didn't owe any taxes so I didn't have to enter my bank info. The IRS is setting up the website to enter info for people in my situation this Friday, but who knows how long it'll take after that to get the stimulus check.

Even once I get it, I either have to use 1050 of it for rent or face eviction when my state lifts the eviction suspension May 15th. And that 1050 just covers the rent due April 1st, what the hell do I do about May's? I've already gone several days the last few weeks not eating, food banks and warm hearts have been keeping me sustained. Food bank lines are getting longer (3 times as long when I went yesterday compared to the week prior) and they've been handing out less due to the increased demand.

I know I'm not the only person in this situation and week by week more Americans will unfortunately be joining us. I honestly don't know what to do at this point besides keep applying to whatever jobs I can find and pray one finally calls me back. Sorry for the rant, this is all just so stressful, worrying about finding food to eat, inevitable eviction, on top of the loneliness and worry for loved ones everyone else is facing.

I'm sure this question has been answered a million times, but why can't we just shelter the most at risk people? Wouldn't it make more sense to compensate those at risk to stay home, instead of sending $1200 to every single person? I flip back and forth day by day on whether this shut down is doing more harm than alternative measures.

I get that. Isn't the goal to get to 60 percent infection rate though? If we sheltered all of the people who are at risk, wouldn't the hospitalization numbers about even out? Most of the first hand accounts I read from New York are people who would fit in the category that would've been sheltered with what I'm proposing. Just thinking out loud here.

Assuming that there will be no vaccine for at least 10-16 months, so herd immunity is the only way the disease can be eliminated (assuming that the spread is already untraceable and can no longer be contained, not the case for China, SK, Taiwan, HK, Japan) is the lockdown really viable?

To effectively flatten the curve and reach ~70% of people infected and recovered, while having medical resources for everyone having major respiratory complications we would need 10 or more months of lockdown. For example, in the current situation in Italy the virus has already likely passed around 2 million people, that is around 6,5% of the population, so the other 93,5% still lives "pre-lockdown". If the lockdown is partially ceased I see no reason to believe we won't see the Lombardia scenario repeating nationwide.

Due to how the virus acts I can't see middle ground between doomsday lockdown or ending the lockdown and more chaos in hospitals

I noticed the models went up yesterday and I see some states like Georgia now having their expected peak pushed back to first week in May while earlier it was mid April. Is that a good or bad thing? That does give the states extra time to be ready but is the pushback now due to an increase in cases?

Are there any studies or articles explaining why some people get extremely ill while others only have mild symptoms?

I just read an article about a 21 year old who died with no medical conditions but have also seen articles about 90 year olds surviving. Have they gotten any closer to figuring out why some people are more at risk than others? I've heard that it could be blood type related, is this accurate?

Maybe I'm over thinking the situation, but it feels like what they previously told us about the virus isn't adding up. I've been hospitalized in the past due to upper respiratory infections and generally tend to get very sick even with the common cold, I'm an essential worker so my anxiety about this situation just keeps getting worse. I don't know if maybe the news I'm reading isn't reliable, maybe they just aren't telling the full story or what?

No one is deliberately lying to you. We just don't know enough, and changing stories reflect us gradually learning new stuff about the virus.

The more we learn about COVID-19 the more we see how different it is from other similar viruses, which is why a lot of earlier assumptions ended up not being true.

Unfortunately we're still so overwhelmed we can barely keep up with new patients. Very few places are doing wide-scale data collection. We barely have enough data on critical cases / deaths and virtually no data on less severe cases, much less the asymptomatic carriers, in order to draw any kind of conclusions about all the influencing factors.

However 90 year olds surviving are clearly a statistical fluke. Not as much as 17 year olds dying, but generally advanced age is a huge risk factor, as is weaker immune system overall, obesity, and prior respiratory issues.

Mortality rate is still not terrible on an individual level. Even an obese 65-year-old asthmatic is more likely to live than to die. But when you take a hundred of those vs a hundred 21-year-olds in perfect health, that's when the difference becomes scary clear.

It's just luck. There are always outliers, like the younger people dying or older people surviving. There are news articles on those because those incidences are rare. The vast majority of younger people will be fine, and older people are much more likely to die from it. Same as any infection.

I‚Äôm not sure there are enough wartime gas masks stocked up to give out to people. M17 masks were probably all destroyed. People are just getting M50 masks, and units are still using the M40s

The problem with a gas mask is it is a valved respirator. Meaning you are protecting what you breathe in but not protecting against anything you breathe out. N95 is valveless where a proper fit would protect the wearer and everyone around them.

From what I've heard the only responsible way to end the lockdowns is to wait until there's a vaccine. And I know that vaccines take up to 18 months to produce. But there are experts saying that we will be able to go back to normal again before 18 months from when this started. But How would that be possible? What way out is there other than a vaccine?

You can't keep up the lockdown indefinitely, because it too claims lives. People need to be able to work in order to pay for rent and food. People need to be able to freely go outside, meet family, friends in order to not go crazy. At some point the lockdown does more harm than good. The key is to find the right balance between reigning in the virus and opening the world back up to normal. That balance will be somewhere between the two extremes.

The point of lockdowns was never to eliminate the virus altogether or wait for a vaccine (which may never come). The point is to avoid healthcare systems becoming overwhelmed and hopefully buy time to increase testing capacity/PP/ventilator supply and maybe even find effective treatments for severe cases. Shutting down until there‚Äôs a vaccine would do far more harm than good.

Probably not any time soon. Ramping up production isn't an easy thing in real life. You need production lines, you need workers, and not just as the 3M factories but all the way up and down the supply chain. That supply chain is one major factor why production can't ramp up quickly.

Nonwoven polypropylene from which the filters are made is in short supply and there are very few places that can make it at quality and quantity, and their own production is limited by the shortage of a critical component they themselves need, polypropylene resin.

Worldwide production of N95s increased dramatically over the past couple of months, but demand shot up through the roof. Due to supply chain issues factories still do sit idle waiting for raw materials.

I think the companies that do produce them ARE focused on producing as many as possible. But the fact of the matter is, they can not even produce them fast enough for the hospitals that need them, let alone the general public. I am thinking we will never have these available to the public again. Will people who are immunocompromised be able to get them for everyday use? Probably. But there will be a push to have a large stockpile of them going forward rather than just selling them.

I‚Äôd say it depends on how much you trust your friends to stick to the distancing. I‚Äôd probably try to stick to a 10-12 foot minimum distance from others if possible too. Outdoors is definitely good though. Really just depends how much risk you want to take, not going is obviously safer, but if your group takes the right precautions it could be OK.

My opinion is you will have to undergo extreme measures for a long time in order to not get sick. You only have to slip up once.

Conversely if you have no preexisting conditions it may be okay to risk it. I would even argue that otherwise healthy folks may be at an advantage if they can catch it and develop an immunity. At least then you don't have to worry anymore, you can participate in society again, and you will be doing your part to build herd immunity.

I‚Äôm just finally feeling like I hit rock bottom. I‚Äôve posted here before about my work and how they‚Äôre not doing enough to protect us. Giving us one mask each to reuse, continuing to conduct non essential business even after being advised not to, no strict social distancing policy even though my state has mandated it. I reached out to my manager and administrator with my concerns and was ignored.

I emailed my manager on Monday and said I wasn‚Äôt coming in because I didn‚Äôt feel safe, I once again highlighted all my concerns. I chose email over phone call because I wanted written documentation of my concerns. I left a voicemail on my admins cell on Friday. No response from either. I know they got my messages because if they hadn‚Äôt they would have been calling me yesterday asking why I wasn‚Äôt at work.

I guess that means I‚Äôm out of a job then? Idk they never gave me my schedule for this week so I‚Äôm not even sure when I‚Äôm supposed to be in next. And no response at all to me not going in or expressing my concerns seems so bizarre...I‚Äôm just super tired of this shit.

That job has always treated me poorly so it was time to move on anyway, but now is the worst possible time for it to finally happen. And I doubt I can collect unemployment because they could easily just say that I quit since I didn‚Äôt go in. Now I‚Äôm second guessing myself, thinking I should have just shut up and gone with the flow like everyone else. At the same time our clientele is largely seniors and it just seems criminal to me to keep doing nonessential business and putting them at risk as well.

Idk I just needed to vent. Thanks to anyone who read the whole thing.

I appreciate your courage to do what is right, and stand up for yourself at one of the most difficult times.

It might not mean too much from a stranger online, but I‚Äôm proud of you. I work at a grocery store right now and they are having ‚ÄúEaster sales‚Äù and cutting our hours even though we are making record sales. They are also not providing gloves or masks.

What you did proves your strength, and you did it because you knew it was the right thing to do.

Does coronavirus like low altitudes? Wuhan, New York, New Orleans, Miami, Milan, Guayaquil, Brussels have all low altitudes. They all have high amount of cases per capita. Also there are many outbreaks in ships.

The ships are due to population density, which is higher than the most densely populated cities. Then there's the fact that more than 30% of humans live between sea level and 100m above sea level but that this land makes up less than 20% of inhabited land, which is why the most densely populated cities are at lower elevation. This makes sense because access to water, fishing, shipping all is more possible at lower elevations.

tl;dr correlation is not causation

I‚Äôm not sure how detailed of an answer you want, but I‚Äôll give the basics.

In epidemiology, deaths are simply one indicator; in fact, deaths are typically the most lagging indicator, meaning that death toll is a different curve, ‚Äòrolling‚Äô behind the actual incidence curve.

This means that, while death counts may be still increasing, the main indicators of the disease are several days or weeks ahead of that number. The really vital numbers for a public health professional are: new cases, percentage of new cases requiring hospitalization, and new hospitalizations requiring ICU/intubation.

These are the numbers that show the ‚Äòflattening‚Äô you hear about. New cases throughout most of the hot spots are slowing, and they are requiring less ICU beds per case each day.

The US is, despite the alarming numbers blasted on tv every day, appearing to be hitting the peak (or descending the peak) in many of the worst places, and that is a very good thing.

So I opened up r/china_flu cause I saw a link on here. And suddenly that lab theory isn't too crazy. Not that it was engineered but that it was, sourced from nature, misshandled and then leaked. I'm not saying it's true but look at it.

Yeah I don‚Äôt like how people are so binary on that theory, I don‚Äôt for a second believe China engineered this virus for the sole purpose of releasing it. But I think a theory that holds some credibility is that they where tinkering with SARS and there was an accidental break in containment.

Even if that honestly had enough external validity to be true, you can't unring a bell. Trying to find the etiology helps us understand if humans should avoid something (animals/ places). Knowing it was mishandled/cultivated in a lab setting has no value to treatment.

All this theory does is help people to find someone to blame. Which is a natural Kubler-Ross thing. But other than that, not at all constructive.

Now if we're looking to blame someone for ignoring pandemic plans or firing investigation teams, or dropping the ball on producing sufficient PPE. . . that does not require a conspiracy theory.

Yes, but no more than walking through air exhaled by a nonsmoker. Actually that isn't quite true because smokers are a bit more likely to catch C19. But as long as you were >6 feet away the risk is very small.

Hey, this is kind of a long shot, but if you are (or know anyone who is) a dietician or nutritionist, could I schedule an appointment with you for a friend?

She is immunocompromised and has been incredibly stressed out due to COVID 19. Last week, she told me that she‚Äôs thinks she might have started binge eating to cope with the pandemic, but she isn‚Äôt sure. She‚Äôs vegetarian and exercises regularly, but with how hungry she‚Äôs been getting, she isn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs been eating enough. Either way, her relationship with food is really hurting her mental health even more, and she had really bad breakdown last night. I can‚Äôt stand to see her like this, and I want to help her out however I can.

We live in a fairly small town, and everywhere she‚Äôs called so far hasn‚Äôt even been able to give her an estimate of when they can see her. She also doesn‚Äôt know if her insurance will cover it. However, I‚Äôm sure I could scrape some of my own money together and try and come up with something reasonable to pay you or your contact.

Thank you in advance.

Can anyone help me out? Im getting 10 week furlough at my job. I‚Äôm wondering if the US government has started giving out the additional $600 per week for unemployment? I can‚Äôt survive off normal unemployment benefits.

Hope the stimulus check comes soon too. Heard you can track it online website starting on the 17th via IRS.

Does anyone know how long it may take from my last day of work and filing that day or the next day to how long untill I receive my first unemployment check? I get my last work check 2 weeks after my last day of work.

Just hoping to figure all this timeline out as I don‚Äôt have an emergency fund.

How do you all deal with coronavirus misinformation in your family and friends circles?

My parents get these crazy coronavirus conspiracy videos that talks about how the "governments" want to get rid of people over 70 or it's a financial thing or whatever on WhatsApp and they actually believe them, sometimes I feel like they want to believe these people words instead of every doctor/scientist around the world.

Like the other guy said, just cut those people out of your life, and if it's family, limit contact, or don't talk about these things with them. People like that aren't interested in learning the truth. They've decided the world is the way they want it to be, and they're only ever going to be an annoying headache.

I realize this is an incredibly first world problem, but does anybody else have no idea what to do with their vacation time this year? I've been hoarding mine up to take a couple big trips this year, but I don't think that's happening, so now I'm kind of stuck. I'm hoping outdoor activities are open in the summer again so I can at least take some days to go hiking or golfing, but I really don't want to take time off just to spend even more time in my house.

Although would-be COVID-19 therapies like the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the failed Ebola drug remdesivir have drummed up excitement as potentially life-saving treatments, a comprehensive review of available data finds that it's still too early to tell. The review, published in JAMA on April 13, 2020, summarizes what's currently known about medical therapies used to treat COVID-19, concluding that "no therapies have been shown effective to date." Researchers at the University of Texas analyzed evidence on major proposed COVID-19 treatments published by the end of March 2019 and written in English. They found no strong evidence that any potential COVID-19 therapy is effective.

Why does this sub delete everything related to politics?

The mods either lock every politics-related thread or completely remove it for no apparent reason.

It doesn't make sense since politics are obviously a big part of the whole pandemic and determine many things. Civil discussion about it should be encouraged, not oppressed.

I guess because political discussions tend to get derailed and it would require a far greater effort to moderate the sub if they are allowed.

Also it would be better if we can manage to keep this sub just for information and knowledge.

r/news and r/worldnews have the political discussions related to the pandemic that you might like.

At what point do all us and the millions of people at home get involved in this covid fight by not only staying at home but being able to help in some other way? If this means everyone on the planet needs to start reading the course work to become a disease expert then so be it. Think about it, if we had millions of people trying to learn this, I feel quite possibly we could find something that the doctors and scientists aren‚Äôt seeing at the moment? There‚Äôs only so many of them and they can‚Äôt do all the work by themselves. We have brilliant minds in this world, I know we could utilize the power of the internet as a whole we could make a huge stride towards this fight which at the moment is looking uncertain and daunting.

We shouldn't be quick to find blame, but there's no proof to rule it out.

In the press briefing today, when Trump was talking about the WHO, he mentioned that China hasn't let the WHO or anyone else visit the origin-point of the virus yet. If that's true, why is China doing that? China could dispel all the various theories about the virus if they let the expert in, but even the journalists are banned now.

I don't think China gives a f*** about conspiracy theories. This is a country where there's literal evidence of re-education camps filled with people who are being abused day in and day out. We have actual evidence of awful shit they're doing, and nobody gives a shit.

Google the Nipah virus. Also similar to covid but it was contained in India because they did the quarantine right away the moment the doctors alerted the government. China, in the other hand, silenced and threatened the whistleblowers. China is to blame in all of this.

Nipah was relatively easy to contain because it's comparatively low reproductive rate which is not the case with covid19. Nipah is also very deadly which is not the case with covid19.

3600 over the last ~4 weeks from non-confirmed but probable cases.

It honestly sounded kinda weird to me ‚Äî I may have misunderstood it but sounded like they were including ones that tested negative even. I know there is a problem with false negatives but that sounds pretty confusing to me.

Just read that NYC added people who were presumed to have covid19 but were not tested to confirm it to its death toll. Guess that would explain the sudden increase.

Anyone else been noticing the really crappy data coming out of WHO?
I've been recording their numbers daily, and they have multiple entries over the last month with the same data points for both confirmed cases and deaths.

US: 6-mar through 8-mar, confirmed cases was the exact same @ 213.
15-mar through 16-mar, confirmed cases were both @ 1714.

How on earth do the IMHE models predict essentially zero deaths after June? People will continue to spread this, and no matter how many vents are available, people will die. This virus picks who dies. We don't.

I believe the model assumes social distancing policies stay in place. With that assumption it's entirely possible the model is correct. Whether that assumption becomes reality, I doubt it.

I don't agree with that aspect of the bottle, there's cases starting up now that in six weeks may be fatalities. Just looking at the difference between some of the other Metro centres and New York / New Jersey. there's a lot of Miss representation on how insidious this virus is, it's slow to take hold, but once it starts community transmission without extreme detection measures there really isn't any other way to stop a rapid upswing in cases.

The problem is we essentially have no idea what the equilibrium will end up looking like over the long term (in western democracies at least). Our best example for that is China, but people here are not going to accept those kind of restrictions on their freedom. It's much more likely we will end up with a long tail with multiple smaller peaks over time.

Right, and the models should be able to reflect to a degree that people will spread, and die until months after a vaccine is made. I'll get off my soap box, but it's not gonna be a bell shape, gonna be a long downward tilted plateau.

How come people like to criticize Florida? They are doing just as good as California yet California gets nothing but praise. And before you say they aren't testing enough, neither is California. Cali is only testing people that show symptoms, and you have to get a referral from your doctor(most places).

And yet, they're not doing so bad. Despite all the complaints about spring breakers and packed beaches, there is no spike in Florida, no overwhelmed medical system, no need for field hospitals. Makes you wonder if heat/humidity really do make a difference.

Or maybe minor differences in shutdown speed are not very important compared to huge differences in lifestyle between NYC on the one hand and Florida + CA on the other: Barely any walkable areas (esp. in LA, Miami, San Jose etc.), vast majority of people drive, giant stores in which it's easy to avoid people etc.

I bet it's both: climate + lifestyle differences.

I believe that it does, but the science is still out. It is very odd that Florida is not in worse shape given A) how old the population is and B) how late they were to shutting down and C) the constant influx of travelers from NY and Europe. All of those risk factors should spell certain doom, but it hasn't, strangely enough.

Florida has an older, (excuse my French) fatter population, so the right strategy for Florida is going to be more cautious than what works for California. Of course luck can spare Florida from the worst case scenario, but government leaders shouldn‚Äôt be banking on luck.

I've seen this one. Thank you. Do you have one that considers human psychology as well? The linked seems to be purely about dollars and cents, but I think it's important to also consider psychological, emotional, and societal impacts of long-term, indefinite shutdowns, especially when paired with uncertainty of when it will end. Personally, I think after a certain amount of time, people will say F* it and go out and about anyway.

This virus ain't going away at this point, way too widespread. If we wanna get herd immunity by stopping social distancing the death toll would be very high. What are yall thoughts on this? Do you think hot weather will play a role or would people have to wait for a vaccine

I doubt hot weather will play much of a role, but I agree, it's not going anywhere. The best we can do while we wait for a vaccine is ease up the pressure on hospitals. It's not really realistic to have everyone stay home for 18 months, so we'll just need to do what we can to limit spread. Wear masks, wash hands frequently, keep distance, etc.

It'll be a "newer normal" for a while. Most of us are going to catch this at some point, but if we can slow down the rate at which that happens, start to build some immunity and eventually get a vaccine, we'll be able to return to normal normal.

Keep in mind that herd immunity is only an assumption with COVID-19. We don't actually know whether previously sick people get reinfected or not. We especially don't know if having been infected with strand A will prevent you from being infected by strand B. We don't even know if the antibodies are not contagious.

Waiting until we have more data is crucial to making an informed decision. Plenty of countries are volunteering to be free-for-all petri dishes. We should have a much better idea in a number of weeks / months.

Social distancing will decrease the spread of the virus. It will be in smaller and smaller geographic areas where when it does pop up we can quickly react and get it back under control while we wait for a vaccine.

Just curios, is there any single site where one can get reliable up-to-date with headline news of each region in regards to Coronavirus? I try to follow many places in the world, but it is quite cumbersome to search for information in many different places. Maybe there is something out there that collects the most important news of each region?

what is the true "low down" on antibody testing, especially at-home tests?

I keep seeing announcements and mentions of provider-based tests and then the UK mentioned they are going to provide an antibody test via amazon, etc. in the UK but then after reviewing what they bought, rejected them all?

https://archive.is/53b25

Several chinese firms have notified the FDA they are making kits but they don't actually need approval if they aren't going to seek FDA clearance? Are they the same as what the UK sourced?

none of these are antibody right

https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd

None of these seem to have even gotten emergency use approval and they are not "at home" tests

If you've been sick for a month I think you should be worried whether or not you have covid-19

If you've been sick for over a month you should go see a doctor. That's not normal at all.

JH map confirmed cases in the US just dropped by another 10K from an hour or two ago. The number of confirmed cases suddenly being lowered with no explanation is happening more and more often. There can't be that many "entering errors" or "mapping glitches" causing the graphs to change. What's going on?

Yes, but this is in the number of confirmed cases, not active cases. Recovery has nothing to do with this.

I really hope that‚Äôs the case and it‚Äôs definitely possible. It‚Äôs just hard to say because I never get those. And the grocery store I went to last Friday was a shitshow, I could easily have caught it there. But yeah hopefully you‚Äôre right and it‚Äôs passes much sooner than the virus would. I‚Äôve been resting and drinking water all day. Thanks and stay healthy yourself!

Doesn't do shit for the construction workers who need them to work around toxic dusts and other hazards. N95 respirators get dirty and used up in about 4 hours in a very dusty environment, you could wear one for maybe 8 hours in a moderately dusty day.

N95 Production needs to be ramped up, by the hundreds of millions a week. No amount of sanitizing will be able to prevent the shortage. A disposable item is always disposable and using an n95 past 8 hrs is going to decrease its effectiveness and then whatever method you use to sanitize it will too. Decrease the effectiveness that much, and you might as well wear a paper/surgical mask.

There's simply not enough N95s to go around. Every industry that's always used them still needs them, it's not right for workers or healthcare professionals to have to expose themselves to either the virus or hazardous particles caused by construction. The production capacity will have to increase exponentially. I would invest in any companies making legit n95s right now.

They probably work but volumes are absolutely enormous and all around the place. I would assume the consumption is like tens of millions of masks a day in USA alone. You also need someone to collect, operate and distribute the material.

Can governments determine the true number of cases within their country by normalizing the data by considering the number of people they have tested? Which countries have already done this, and which have not? I‚Äôm doing a research project on this right now and any help is appreciated!

The number tested will be heavily biased towards positive cases.

Many governments are now conducting random sampling of populations via antibody tests to determine how many people actually have had the virus.

I don't know of any results yet but It's going to be really interesting to see the them.

weekly cdc puts out the total % of all hospital calls that were for "flu like symptoms" so that's a good start for it



odds that a fever is covid you'd need to know all the other sources of fever. use a differential diagnosis by calling your local nurse line and let them walk you through all the symptoms to see if you have more than one

I am on Day 10 of first symptoms of Covid-19. I only had about 3 days of on and off malaise, one or two days of diarrhea, some throat soreness, a bit of shortness of breathe, some body soreness. I never got a fever. Most symptoms were gone by day 4. But then I completely lost taste and smell. I caught a whiff of bacon frying, but can barely taste Rae garlic. I can taste when there is sweet and faintly taste bitter. Anyone else lost taste and recovered it? How long did it take?

We don't know.

Based on other similar coronaviruses, most people who recover should be immune, or have some level of immunity (less severe symptoms) for about 1 year or so.

There have been reports of people in SK getting "re-infected" after recovering but there is a lot that could cause that. These are people who previously tested negative (after recovering) but later tested positive again. We don't know if these people are getting sick again or are still contagious. We also don't know if this is a result of an incorrect test (false negative from before, or false positive now), or a result of virus RNA that is still in the body but not necessarily active. We also don't know if the current tests are good enough.

For example, they did some studies and found that many people still had virus RNA in their stools a month after recovering.

From what I understand, and RNA primer amplification PCR-based test is extremely difficult to test for a false positive and almost impossible. It's the false negatives that are actually end up soaking majority of the false statistic

It would be on someone who had never had the virus but on people who've had the virus they will have viral RNA all over the place as their body sheds it. That's what tests are picking up.

Extremely long viral RNA shed times. Until someone tests negative multiple times after recovery and then tests positive again after a month or more, which hasn't happened, it's not happening.

Sars cov 2 travels via droplets from talking or sneezing or coughing. Virus reaches someone else's mucus membranes like nose eyes or mouth where it binds to ace 2 receptor in lung cells and makes copies of itself inside the cell and the cell bursts releasing thousands of virus particles

I saw the wiki lists but nothing really that shows major cities and their dates, just lists by country. I know I can sift through the data to find out where and when the first case was reported but was hoping it would already be available somewhere.

It's essentially like the needle and pin feeling one gets when a foot is asleep. But this happens randomly over the body, it's like a soda fizzing feeling. It's just over small areas and for a couple seconds then goes away and can start in a different area of the body. I first heard about this on NBC News, bur haven't found people on Reddit talking about it.

I had this a few weeks ago - for me I am not sure it‚Äôs covid related though. At the time, I googled it and it seemed like a symptom of anxiety. However, I‚Äôve had anxiety for years and have never had this before. I‚Äôve been isolating for about 5 weeks, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm positive but I do live in NYC and was on the subway up until March 6. Those articles have been catching my attention too. I felt like my body was buzzing (it was mostly in my legs/feet but sometimes in my chest). Very odd.

Can someone tell me how the virus spreads? How do you catch it? Can you catch it by breathing it in? I just need a refresher on this information, please.

It is contracted by spittle, like a flu or cold.

If you get some onto your mucus membranes, like eg if someone talks to you(and spits) and you inhale ultra small(~100nanometers) particles they exhale(like when coughing etc) Or if you touched a surface and smear it into your eyes, nose or breathe it in directly.

Then you can get an infection.

It is not airborne, but can survive in a windstll environment for hours floating, apparently. Also several hours and even up to 3 days on clean surfaces in the right conditions.

Yes, if someone has already got the virus, if he just talks to you, there are small droplets that can reach you by that person is talking and high chance you can get it too. Thats why it is highly advices to stay away at least 2m from each other.

The virus is airborne; yes you can catch it by breathing it in as well as you can pass it on just by breathing. That's why it's crucial everyone wears a mask, so we protect each other.

Are there any COVID19-related talks led by scientists/researchers that are being streamed in the coming week or so that you're aware of? One of my courses wants us to attend a STEM lecture in some form, and I thought something related to current research efforts with respect to the virus would be interesting.

Depends on your definition of normalcy. Completely normal.....we are waiting for a vaccine or some damn effective antiviral treatments.

Psuedo normalcy- where we still wear masks and sports are only on TV without crowds....no big concerts or movie theaters and tons of other social distancing stuff..... That might be trickled back piece by piece. Check out the Governor of California's press conference today. He explained thier plans for return to "new normal" and what is needed in order to do that. I imagine many other states will be following suite.

Well best of luck getting any semblance of an economy or normalcy back. Enjoy the greatest depression.

Short story: everyone learns to wear N95 mask and gloves properly, never ventures out without them. Except for the PPE, everything goes back to normal in 3 weeks. No mask, no gloves, no service. We start testing for antibodies, and the recovered get a badge to wear exempting them from the PPE requirement if they desire. Contagion dwindles to a managable level and stays there until antibody surveillance finds a region has achieved the requisite level of immunity (>82%). Then everyone there can take the masks off.

Of course this requires ridiculous quantities of PPE. And the factories to produce that have been spinning up for 2 months. It's coming.

first and foremost we do not have the imagination for this thing. the 1918 flu pandemic killed 675,000 in a nation half as populous. a rural nation at that. it lasted till 1920-21. it was a societal changing event.

remember after it finished big cities and populous state then it works it way thru rural america and then to places where we do alot of biz , say mexico or thailand or vietnam

we don't even talk about those places, like mexico somehow miraculously avoid CV19.

mexico is our 2nd largest trading partner. alot of stuff comes out of mexico.

So the common estimates I'm seeing are that recovering from corona will probably provide you with immunity for 1-3 years. But what if you're exposed to it constantly, does that extend your immunity? Say you get sick, recover, and over the next 2 years you're exposed to corona once or twice a month on average. Will that extend the immunity, or does your immune system do a hard reset after 1 or 2 years, regardless of exposure?

I'll be moving in with family when my lease ends next month. My strategy is to self-quarantine for a few weeks in a separate room in case I got exposed during the move. Overall, it's low risk but many cases are asymptomatic so it's good idea to isolate yourself when you arrive.

One of our speakers is Rino Rappuoli from GSK Vaccines so I thought it might be worth sharing the webinar with the community so that anyone can hear out and ask questions if any.

It will start in 40 minutes, you can register here.

I don't have one. I'm not an expert in these fields. I just think those in charge should be more heavily relying on that kind of assessment by the experts in making their decisions. And in doing so I think they should be more clearly articulating these assessments to the public.

"The economy" is not a group of billionaires swimming in pools filled with gold coins. It encapsulates all production and trade. To say the economy doesn't matter is to say production and trade don't matter. If you want to live in some prehistoric fantasy then you can find some remote location and do it, but don't attempt to drag down the rest of us.

Seasonal flu kills up to 100k per year and nobody even thinks about it, so 100k should be a totally uncontroversal number.

Going from "not even thinking about it" to "holy shit close everything, " I think puts us at a few multiples of that. The actual number would be contingent on how immunity works. It's not reasonable to have 300k die every year, but if 300k die in one year and then we never worry about COVID-19 ever again, maybe worth it.

You should have her confirm. An antibody test means that you had Covid-19 and now have immunity typically.

That i don't know. I think my point was there is a test to see if you currently have it (which has been available for a while) and a test to show if you've had it. I don't know if the antibody test would work if you were currently infected.

Yes. I had one of the non fda approved antibody tests and was told there are four possible results: negative/negative, negative/positive, positive/negative, and positive/positive.

Positive/positive result means a recent infection that has developed antibodies, and could still be shedding virus. Negative/positive means early stages of antibody response and could be active infection/shedding virus.

Even if you get a negative/negative result though they warn you that it can take up to 7 days to develop antibodies so it still doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôre not carrying the virus. I got negative/negative and tbh it didn‚Äôt give me any peace of mind.

Even the best result, positive/negative, which should mean you‚Äôve had the virus already and developed immunity, can be misleading because the test can pick up if you‚Äôve got any antibodies from past infections from other viruses in the SARS family.

So basically it‚Äôs kind of useless imo. Not saying people shouldn‚Äôt get tested, but idk, some of these tests we have available right now aren‚Äôt exactly filling me with confidence.

You‚Äôre welcome. I‚Äôm not sure what the actual stats are for false negatives/positives, but I know it‚Äôs high enough that some first responders were recommending against taking that particular antibody test, due to it being largely considered unreliable.

It can create confusion, and in this case they are only testing for the long-term antibodies so it's either positive or negative. With your test it sounds like they tested for both. So she could have it in the later stages and still be contagious or in the clear.

It means that your body is producing the antibodies to fight the infection. Early on these may not be at the concentration needed to be detected, but midway through they would be. With out a regular nasal tests it's really difficult to take anything away from the test. If anything it creates more confusion.

So I have to wonder...is this "meat shortage" thing true? I keep seeing on Facebook (yeah I know...) about how there's no meat anywhere and farms and factories are shutting down. I don't eat pork, ever. I may eat red meat twice a week, if that. I mostly eat chicken but even that was hard to find yesterday when I went to Walmart. :/

No, not really. But I have been seeing it all over. On FB and reddit. Just curious and asking. I figured it was fearmongering and trying to induce panic buying anyways.

Probably depends on where you live. In my area meat is fully stocked with no limits on how much you can buy.

If anything, the lack of food demand/exports to China has made meat/seafood prices drop by half in the US. If it‚Äôs not profitable anymore, the big plants will start to shut down though. That‚Äôs where I believe these ‚Äòshortage‚Äô articles come out.

TLDR: Meat industries need bailout money to remain operational at current prices

People have been panic buying, from what I've seen its been processing facilities shutting down to non contract meat processing. There are still plenty of animals so we won't run out of meat, in theory less is being made every day but the main processing plants are still running at full steam so a healthy majority of the market is still active.

Look, there are supply chain disruptions happening in all industries and product categories. Any amount of panic buying is only going to make matters worse for EVERYONE. First it was hand sanitizer, then sanitizing wipes, then toilet paper, and on and on.

Shouldn't California, Washington, Oregon, include Arizona, and Nevada in their group of states to reopening? A lot of people from those States and California travel back and forth. Wouldn't make a lot of sense to exclude them.

To be fair the usa has under reported recoveries because they aren't monitoring anyone they send back home. Because when you recover, spending 300-1000 bucks for someone to confirm that sucks ass.

I'm trying to find poignant and compelling ways to make real the true horror of the death stats, especially in the USA. People struggle to understand numbers in the abstract.

With about 30,000 deaths in the US at the time of writing. If you read the names of the deceased at the rate of one every 5 seconds, it would take you more than 43 hours straight to read the current list. That's not including today's victims.

Spain is starting to relax some of their lockdown measures https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/spain-relaxes-lockdown-as-daily-coronavirus-death-toll-falls-to-517

In China the Immunity Passport program ("Green Codes" on cellphones) is up and running, has so far reported 4 separate cases where people who were though to be cleared were in fact positive, but all cases seems to have gotten contained relatively quickly. If they can keep this up they might be able to prevent a second wave but its too soon to tell.

Can you reuse a face mask if you are only using it only to walk your pet on an empty park? If yes, what maintenance steps should I follow?

There is scarcity of facemaks in my country. However, the government made at an obligation to use them in public. Hence, I do not want to waste face masks only to walk my dog outside for 10 minutes on an empty park.

Everyone is holding out hope for a vaccine, but we don't even know if one is possible nor do we know when it would be available. Vaccines take many years, sometimes decades, and in many cases a vaccine is not even possible.

So, besides a vaccine, why can we not try to snuff this out completely using aggressive test and trace and quarantine measures? It would have to come with a full travel ban, or at least on the spot testing before you are allowed to travel.

Or has this thing spread around too much and will forever be out in the open?

It's a bug with BNO. The number of lives they are reporting lost in NY is not accurate. The correct number is 10,834 total for NY.

EDIT: This is based off Gov. Cuomo's twitter post 6 hours ago.

I find BNO to be horribly inaccurate, I don't understand why it continues to be listed here. The most accurate tracker I've used (and the one I've continued to use) is the one by worldometer: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

Read in WSJ that "NY deaths soar above 10k" as they add 3800 "probable" deaths to the total. Am I missing something or wouldn't that being the totally to over 13k? It doesn't look like those 3800 are included since we were over 9000 yesterday

From that article:

Earlier Tuesday the city‚Äôs health officials said 6,589 city residents died of the Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Adding those who probably had it boosted the tally above 10,000 victims.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/nursing-homes-remain-a-concern-as-new-yorks-coronavirus-outbreak-appears-to-plateau-11586892250

This was actually incorrectly reported. The additional were not included. The number in NY is actually now 14,064 so those 3k+ hadn't been added in to that 10k total.

What state do you live in? You may be eligible for the EFMLA act which will pay you 2/3 of your salary for up to 12 weeks.

In California, we have the California Family Rights Act which pays 2 weeks sick pay without using PTO and can be used in conjunction with the EFMLA (Emergency Federal Family Medical Leave Act). In other words you can take up to 12 weeks off, the first two paid in full, the next 10 paid at 2/3 of your current salary. Their is a list of criteria that has to be met to take advantage of this I believe at DOL.gov.

The reason I asked which state you were in is because I believe a shelter in place order from a sitting governor qualifies you for EFMLA. Talk to your HR person, they should know all about this.

That‚Äôs where the California law fills in that gap which is nice. If you have a combination of 80 hours vacation/sick pay, you can get those first two weeks paid in full obviously.

And if you have any PTO left over, I‚Äôm fairly certain you can use your own PTO with the EFMLA to fill in the 1/3 pay that will be missed.

Or get fired and refuse to sign anything agreeing it‚Äôs your fault. Then it becomes a battle between you and your employer with the unemployment office. Each state is different, but there is due process. If they can‚Äôt prove you did anything wrong, you might be able to claim unemployment.

Why is the media saying Sweden is getting out of control by not fully locking down? This chart doesn't really seem to indicate that. I understand their death rate is higher, but their healthcare system isn't being overwhelmed either... weird.

Sweden is seeing unabated exponential growth. Their deaths per capita are higher than the US, and likely to continue to increase at an exponential rate until they make a change. I wish them luck.

I wash my hands when I get home, then as normal - after I go to the bathroom, before I eat. Why would you wash your hands more often than that? Unless you live with an infected person, you won't pick up the virus at home.

Wash them after touching something that could be contaminated. So if you touch a door knob of a store, wash your hands ASAP and don‚Äôt touch anything else (especially your face) until you do. If you touch your bedroom door knob and no one living with you is infected, no need to wash your hands

Wash them when you arrive home, or after handling anything that has been outside your home. While you're at home, no need to wash them more than usual.

Increases the risk of their care providers/relatives getting sick.

The already shaky legal ground (source : all the lawsuits with different outcomes) for the lockdowns would be even shakier targeting populations based on age or health.

I'm sure there's more but those are what come to mind.

We had a bit of a bump today but the increase is trending down overall.

March 22nd we had a 39% increase in daily deaths over the previous day.

After March 28th, it remained lower than 30%.

April 3rd was the last time it was 20% or above.

April 11th, 12th, and 13th, the increase was under 10%. [edit: had these dates wrong]

April 14th, the daily deaths increased to 10%,from 9% on Monday, so a small bump up but you can see that the overall trend of the increase is going down. At the peak, there won't be any growth at all, then we will have negative growth, with fewer people dying each day.

Huge caveat is: This could change if we relax the quarantine too quickly. However, considering if we had stayed at 30% or even 20%, we'd be seeing 10,000 dead per day, I'd say we have done a fairly good job all things considered.

(I did the math and if we slowed from 39% increase to immediately 20% and stayed there, we would have 6,200 people dying every day, more than twice as many as we have right now. It could have been a lot worse.)

Yeah, that's going to be a problem and we might see another spike. We have flattened the curve somewhat though and those of us who are rational and understand that you're still going to have thousands of deaths a day after the peak can continue our quarantine while idiots get each other sick.

or the pork plant in SF, SD, 350 cases. they close down the plant, 350 people in a state with no shelter in place order are now roaming the plains state.

To be fair, we're right in the zone of the projected peak. Testing capacity hasn't really improved but there has been a leveling off / slow down of new daily confirmed cases. Distancing is working. What we'll do 'after', I have no idea.

Our Russian TV shows are so retarted. Famous singer Stas Myhailov was tested 6 times in live broadcast before positive test, and in my small rural area even doctors who work with coronapositive patients don't have enough tests for themselves.

Just looking at the numbers today the death rate for the US alone appears to be between 12% and 23% at the 14 day and 18 day marks(average infection to death is about 18 days). Assuming we have peaked for the first time, we should see 1,168,146 infected and averaging the the numbers above, around 210,000 deaths.

Germany's response seems to put them between 4.5% and 6.5%, which is expected to be the best medical care and response available. Expected death there will be around 11k.

First time in my life I hope my numbers are wrong.

Please be safe and treat this seriously. It can pass from breathing or sneezing 2 isles away from a single infected person. Can take hours to settle out of the air, and you are very likely to track it in on the bottom of your shoes as it settles.

This is before all the lockdowns are released and round 2 spikes due to the falsified reports and information passing around.

Bill Gates stated he believes the actual infection fatality rate is 1 to 1.2%. As a noted expert in infectious disease who is in touch with deepest experts and advocates on Coronavirus, I believe him.

I understand. Without getting complicated, the models are not reflecting actual reality and the more data fed in, the worse the confidence in the models. They should be getting more accurate, but are not. This means they are flawed, and as someone who works with numbers like this, i understand it is due mostly to bad data, data manipulation, and simply stopping recording of cases by limiting or refusing testing.

I have no inside data, im not a doctor. Just someone who uses statistics in my job daily. All the data is corrupt or downright wrong. Best I can do is take the number of cases reported 14 and 18 days ago and simple math from the number of infected 2 weeks ago, divided by the number of current deaths. Pulled my numbers directly from the john hopkins models based on deaths today verses March 27 and 31 cases available.

I apologize to those who tried to message me, and would respond if I could still see your messages. As I said, I hope I am wrong. My intent is only to get people to treat this as if someone life matters, and to be a bit more vigilent.

Boy, this is some 'impressive' mental gymnastics to claim 12% to 23% death rate. I know math is hard, but how about 3rd grade stuff. Let's start with numerator and denominator....

The death rate is not 15%. Rn according to the CDC website there are currently about 588,000 cases in the U.S. if you take that with the confirmed amount of deaths which is about 24,000. You do some simple division. 24k divided by 588k = roughly 0.04. The death rate here is about 4% which is still high but no where near where you are putting it at.

Here is my daily attempt to make people consider that contact tracing is no longer viable. Do some research on it if you are interested. Also want to throw out there that goal is mitigation not containment. This mean slowly building herd immunity while minimizing negative consequences of virus. This includes health and economic outcomes. This will end when we have herd immunity but areas can open up as long as hospital infrastructure is not overwhelmed.

Well, who is going to do contact tracing when the numbers get into the millions? Due to privacy laws, we cannot do it with just cell phone tracing. So we need to send people to check on millions of people, and check and document who they were interacting with, and so on... -- not realistic.

Millions of Swedes will die eventually at one point or another of their life, but there's only 10 millions of them so I would turn down the catastrophism a notch or two.

Regarding food shortages, would reducing meat package sizes across the board encourage people to buy less at a time and reduce food waste? Just a little idea I thought about when reading about meat processing plants getting hit with COVID-19.

Maybe. The biggest issue with this approach is that it requires changing everything from projection lines to the sticker on the packaging. Little changes like this can be incredibly complex.

It mutates slower than flu, which is good. It can mutate. usually in the long term, diseases mutate to be less deadly, because killing your host too quickly usually means you can‚Äôt spread as far.

Can we restart the economy (minus dining and bars) with masks, gloves, and faceshield enforced on everyone? Those things are cheap and could be mass produced.

We don't have to completely eliminate the virus but reduce its transmission rate below 1. Those simple protections could be the key to replace social distancing.

Edit: why the downvotes? Vaccine is more than a year away and we can't keep the economy closed for a year. We have to reopen the economy at some point or more people will die. Without proper protections there will be second/third waves. We don't need N95 masks for the general population and facemasks are just a piece of plastic, some grocery workers and drive-thru workers are already wearing them. Cloth-based masks and plastic-based faceshields are really easy to make and can be used for the general population.

If homemade masks can reduce the transmission chance by 40% and face shield/gloves can further reduce 30%. It is entirely possible that we can reduce R0 from 4 to 1.

Oh damn. Have you tried contacting the CDC and letting them know? Or maybe the president? I know we're currently trying to keep millions of people from dying but I'm sure that if they knew that you had to do something of such herculean importance they would probably re-open the country immediately.

it depends on where you are. I assume the US? If so, your state governor will decide when things open again. The governor of California, for example, said the following 6 things need to happen before the stay-home order can be lifted. In my opinion, these will take weeks if not months.

Ability to monitor and protect our communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating, and supporting those who are positive or exposed

Ability to prevent infection in people who are at high risk

Ability of hospitals and health systems to handle surges

Ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand

Ability for businesses, schools, and child care facilities to support physical distancing

Ability to determine when to reinstitute certain measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.

I despise Trump as much as the next guy but this sub has become a political shithole that constantly plays the blame game (Against political leaders and China) instead of focusing on how we get out of this and leaving blame for after this over.

I believe every country gets the leader it deserves, but I would like to make an exception for the US. The US is no longer the leader in the world and stuck with a elected president acting as a dictator. The current crisis makes it very clear that US has become a second world country with a failing healthcare system, the inability to prevent millions of people ending up in poverty and probably more people killed by guns then by corona. Europe no longer sees the US as a reliable partner. China is helping us now while Trump is making the US look like a fool. I hope the people make some wise choices in the next elections to really make America great again.

It should be telling that most state leaders from both sides of the aisle are doing a great job with overwhelming support from both sides in their states with very little animosity from reporters during their press conferences, yet trump can't seem to get their shit together. It's up to leaders to lead, unfortunately trump would rather play politics than help people. What's funny is it shouldn't be hard to lead in this spot, trump should have an 80% approval rating if he'd just echo what his scientists are saying.

A large amount of his core voters are upset about this lockdown because ‚Äúit will kill more people from poverty than the actual virus‚Äù. Annddd they think that Fauci is in cahoots with WHO and Bill Gates to take over the world with a hoax pandemic that really is a flu. I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory but I joined A LOT of Trump groups and social distancing resistance groups who have very logical and educated counterparts who believe this. So trump is playing politics because he has an election coming up and already has handled this poorly and needs to retain his base with whatever lies he can tell.

How much spread is happening between cars in traffic? Turbulent air is going to keep aerosol particles floating longer. Most cars filter air coming in, but do they filter air going out? Also people drive with their windows open. Safe driving distance is considered to be 2 to 3 seconds between vehicles, but in traffic only a fraction of people actually follow that. Many people are 1 to 2 seconds behind the car in front of them.

Don't know about cars, but there was an article recently that said the six-foot separation rule probably isn't enough when walking briskly, jogging, or running in shared spaces (sidewalks, trails, etc.) It said thirty feet or more may be needed in those situations.

Can someone who is better at science please help me in understanding this study? Is this essentially saying COVID-19 can render T cells useless and cause lasting autoimmune deficiencies similar to HIV?

HIV can replicate itself within T cells, which is why it is such as dangerous disease. No evidence that this virus can do that.

So there‚Äôs talks and pushes for healthcare workers to have their student loans forgiven, and then immediately there are calls demanding that if healthcare workers‚Äô student loans are forgiven, then everyone‚Äôs student loans are forgiven. While I agree with it and I understand the sentiment, it is certainly harder and more expensive to forgive everyone‚Äôs student loans than just the healthcare workers. Is the general public‚Äôs sentiment that if the government are unwilling to pay off everyone‚Äôs student loans, then they shouldn‚Äôt pay off healthcare workers‚Äô either? In other words, do we say that we will not accept anything short of forgiveness of loans for everyone, even if the government agrees to pay off the healthcare worker‚Äôs?

And to the healthcare workers that just finished paying off their student debt prior to the pandemic? What do they get, a pat on the back?

How about provide back-dated hazard pay and a huge bonus to all healthcare workers.

And then forgive everyone's student debt.

Giving healthcare workers hazard pay or extra benefits is slightly annoying to me for a few reasons:

1.) Baked into this is the idea that most people will not get the virus, which I do not think is true. Lets say that 70% of the population eventually gets the virus, would the hazard pay for healthcare workers make as much sense then?

2.) Healthcare workers are normal people. People in a wide range of sectors make sacrifices on a daily basis. Why single this one group? We hear about the sacrifices that healthcare workers are making continuously. Many healthcare workers seem more concerned about their own health than about inadvertently spreading the virus to the at-risk patients that may be seeking care.

3.) The country is already sacrificing a lot so that healthcare infrastructure is not overwhelmed. Almost every american has drastically altered their lives and in many cases given up their livelihood, for the sole purpose of easing the burden on healthcare.

4.) The healthcare sector should have minimal job losses.

No, there is no fair way to pay off a portion of the populations student loans. I know that healthcare workers are currently the heroes, but those in politics that started this discussion just want some brownie points with their bases.

I doubt student load dept will ever be forgiven because schools just charge too damn much and the amount of debt is too high. Schools can do this because students get loans so there is little incentive to lower costs.

Then we shouldn't do anything to help anyone ever unless we help everyone? That's the logic you're proposing.

Here's another brainstorm: Yeah, lets first pay off the loans for the people risking their lives to save ours and then worry about the poetry majors and accountant /political science majors later on maybe. For some reason that doesn't sound that off-the-wall to me.

Edit-I had student loans and after years they are paid off and I don't feel an ounce of "unfairness" if the medical professionals get their's paid off.

New York reported 3,000 connected deaths due to a lack of testing, and a lack of first responder response.

From March 24th to April 10th the paramedical system in New York City has been overwhelmed with calls consistently above the peak of 9/11.

This resulted in response times measuring over an hour. This was causing people to die at home as outlined in: https://mobile.twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/

Tweets

The New York boroughs saw an average of 20 to 25 deaths at home in a day, during the peak call volume that rose to 200+ everyday.

Right. The smoke wouldn't kill the virus so it would still be there. There "might" be some statistical variation one way or the other (smoke is blown out harder than breath, could cause coughing, etc or maybe smoke carries water droplets less etc) but I highly doubt it would be much of a difference.

They‚Äôre saying the virus could‚Äôve potentially been in California since September/October and that they were able to get over it quicker because of herd immunity.

... Wouldn‚Äôt there have been a massive increase in ‚Äúunknown illnesses‚Äù? Or did they rule it as ‚Äúflu-like symptoms‚Äù? Something just seems off about that belief.

Who is saying this? I think I saw one article with this hypothesis.....it is very doubtful. The healthcare system would have noticed.

I saw some reports on TV about it, read some articles as well, but a lot of the info spread has came through Reddit. As you said, the healthcare system would have noticed. I‚Äôm with you on this. I don‚Äôt think the virus has been here since then.

Genetic analysis indicates covid-19 could not have originated any earlier than late October of 2019. So I doubt this idea.

September/October is unlikely, but by December it is likely that it was spreading through the U.S. Think about it. Everyday between the start of December to the Chinese travel ban something like 10,000 people flew from China directly into the U.S. The odds that none of them had contracted a highly contagious disease unknowingly are pretty slim. Early deaths were likely attributed to the flu. Most people with mild symptoms thought they had the flu.

It doesn't make sense that within the past five weeks, coronavirus has hit nearly every county in the U.S. but it took over three months from the Wuhan outbreak for community spread to occur here.

Maybe there was. Idk. But also consider that across 37 states, nursing homes have been hit particularly hard. The "official" spread in the U.S. started about a month ago. Once you factor in lockdowns, how did so many people that don't typically leave the nursuing home for anything over such a large geographical range get sick so quickly? It's likely because asymptomatic relatives and staff were interacting with the residents before people realized coronavirus was spreading through the U.S.

I think if it's true that it was spreading for months before the lockdown, and there was no noticeable uptick in deaths etc, then the lockdown is officially an overreaction

I was suuuuuper sick the Monday before Halloween for 12 days - literally never been that sick ever in my life. No cough or shortness of breath though. I assumed it was the flu until day 5 when I decided to call my dr. She diagnosed me over the phone and said I must have Norovirus (she first asked if I had just gotten back from Africa or if I had known anyone who just traveled to Africa. The answer to both was 'no'.). I didn't lose my sense of smell but it did take two months to fully get my taste buds back. I live in the Bay Area, CA.

I got the same think at the same time. Actually the Thursday before Halloween. I was sick for 10 days and a dry cough for two weeks straight.

But no, I'm sure it was the flu. Some years it doesn't hit too hard, but every once in a while it'll knock you on your ass. Happened to me in '99 as well.

Because people who actually understand what the WHO is and the limits on their power know that they can‚Äôt do anything more than work with what countries let them know.

I sure hope Trump has a plan to create a real word health organization with the power to compel inspections of any country. /s

Seriously - we still need something like the WHO; if they lose their funding, who‚Äôs going to do their job?

What is the job they weren't doing? They reported the information they were given, and warned all nations to take the outbreak seriously when human-to-human transmission was confirmed. They warned repeatedly that there was still time to prevent it becoming a pandemic if nations acted aggressively. Then when it was unstoppable, it was declared a pandemic.

The WHO has no authority to go into China and investigate the outbreak themselves, nor do they have any authority to compel any nation to take any action. They entirely rely on member nations reporting honestly, and acting on their recommendations. While they may have suspicions about the veracity of information coming out of China, there is nothing they could do about it - that's the job of the intelligence community, which have specialized health risk departments. The US government knew the info wasn't reliable and more was going on, so why didn't they act on it.

And who would step up? I don't see the US currently having any interest in creating a global health organization, especially one that isn't

I've been isolating at the house of one of my partners' with just him and my kid, with a supply trip per week at most. my other partner is isolating up north, with even fewer trips into the world. How do I measure the risk of making a trip to see him? I miss him so bad, and phone visits aren't cutting it, as he has limited connectivity and we can't like, do a 6 hour facetime.

Edit, I know its unreasonable to go see him now, I was mostly thinking about when they do start relaxing the stay at home order, whether I'm going to take that risk then. I had originally gone up with him to shelter there a week before my state put out the order, but resource wise it didn't work for me and my kid so we came back to town the day before the order went into effect. So I'm unlikely to start going back out as soon as the order lifts.

if you can do a big stock up trip so that no one in hour current household talks to anyone in person for 2 weeks, then leave to go up north where your partner has been doing the same thing, you'll be fine, presumably you don't have to stop for gas on the way.

once there, stock up on food and get gas, stay two weeks, come back home the same way

I have some questions.

Since around April 10th I‚Äôve had a temp of around mid 98s to high 99 degrees but not pushing 100 so far. We have a temple thermometer. Sometimes it‚Äôll read a whole degree hotter or cooler on one side of my head than the other. What should I believe? Is my high temperature something to worry about? Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know what my normal temp would be.

I have a bit of of a cough but it‚Äôs happening because I feel like something‚Äôs in my throat. Either a cough or clearing my throat will alleviate it for a short while. Is this the ‚Äúdry cough‚Äù listed as a symptom?

I live in Ohio. I don‚Äôt know where I could go to get tested or if I should be worried. I have terrible phone/social anxiety so I am scared to call a number and ask someone the things I wrote here. :( can anyone give me some insight?

ETA: seems like this comes off like I‚Äôm just worrying too much, but with news that most cases are mild, got me thinking maybe I‚Äôve just got a mild case or maybe it will get worse in the coming days

That's not a fever, not even a low-grade fever.

Coughing to clear your throat is not 'having a cough'.

You sound way way too worried. Even if you did have it (I highly doubt you do), you're not going to keel over out of nowhere. It's a gradual disease.

It‚Äôs not a fever? Honestly, I‚Äôve tried googling a lot lately to see what number I should be concerned about seeing but could not find a straight answer. Some places saying people run colder now, or hotter now, than before. So I figured anything above mid 98 is ‚Äúhot‚Äù

Also I don‚Äôt typically have this feeling of something in my throat. So I‚Äôm coughing way more than I usually would. So it had me concerned

I‚Äôm less concerned about myself than I am giving it to my diabetic dad that I live with.

Generally, a doctor wouldn't say you had a fever until you got to around 100.4. You have anxiety problems? That causes many things like you're describing.

You should act like you have it to avoid spreading it to your dad anyways

True. It‚Äôs driving me a little crazy wondering if I am worrying myself sick or if I am actually sick. :( but the safest bet is to act as if I have tested positive when it comes to keeping it away from my dad. I live with mom and dad and they think I am overreacting too. I just don‚Äôt want to assume I‚Äôm fine and then be responsible for making them sick. üò¢

You should really try to get an oral thermometer if at all possible. As a mom of 3 I've owned about a million temporal thermometers and they are approximate guesses at best. Either way, anything under 100.4 is not medically going to be considered a fever. If you feel OK you're probably OK.

Animaniacs forever! Yeah the temporal ones we can buy (saying as opposed to the ones they use in doctors offices) just are not reliable in my experience. I've tried so many brands from cheap to pricey and they all seem to have the same issue.

Home thermometers are notoriously crappy and unreliable. If you feel otherwise fine (no chills, no aches, no deep cough, no shortness of breath) you‚Äôre probably fine. But stay the hell away from other people anyway.

I feel mostly fine. 2 nights ago, I came up two flights of stairs at home and couldn‚Äôt catch my breath / get heart rate down for over 5 min. But I was really panicking at the time too so that prob didn‚Äôt help. My cough isn‚Äôt deep at all right now. I get the occasional chill and aches but that could probably be explained by our current weather and my activity level

I mean, don‚Äôt chill out too much. Be paranoid and overly paranoid moving forward. But, I think you are alright atm. You aren‚Äôt even running a fever, 98 degrees is a weak template for temperature. But it‚Äôs good that you are afraid, stay that way, and you won‚Äôt get ole rona.

A fanciful conspiracy theory but hear me out:

It has been predicted for some years now that we are moving towards AI/technology based work

This virus seems to be affecting the low/‚Äòuseless‚Äô class as Yuval Harari calls them. The poor who can‚Äôt afford healthcare and hand sanitisation, the elderly and even in more recent data, ethnic minorities who are on the fringes of society and in labour jobs etc.

This virus seems to be a way to accelerate this process towards AI/technology dominated society

All widespread calamities disproportionally affect the poor as they are the most vulnerable members of society with fewer resources to cope with events. They have poorer health, less access to health care, poor access to online programs, no savings, few assets and work in at risk job segments.

So this pandemic is no different than any other major calamity - the poor always get a raw deal. What's the conspiracy - other than 'we don't care about poor people'?

Maybe it isn‚Äôt a conspiracy but more an observation - essentially what I am trying to say is that it is not too far fetched to think that the move towards AI needed something like this to make such shift especially with a global ageing population

For every Covid 19 death, there are tens of people born worldwide.

The conspirators will have to find a way to curb the birth rates. Or Covid 19 will be like pissing in a volcano in the long run.

So the conspiracy makes no sense.

Isn‚Äôt the virus pretty much mostly killing the useless class anyway though? Thoughts already more of a burden on society than benefit, weighing down healthcare. I think there should be a point where we either commit long term to this lockdown or come to terms with the class of people it‚Äôs mostly effecting and whether the lockdown is beneficial.

Why do people either get paranoid over coronavirus or else don't care at all?

There seems to be two extremes. Our dumb in-laws have locked themselves in their house for months - have one person bringing them food. They alienated other family by telling them they couldn't come. This was before the stay at home order and long before it showed up here.

Then there are others who walk around without a care in the world, don't wear masks. It seems like they will intentionally avoid social distancing. I've come close to yelling at/confronting some of these who aren't watchful at all. I'm in the middle; I don't want the virus, but not going to let myself go crazy over it.

P.S. I'll be the first to admit I don't like my in-laws. They told my husband he should divorce me when I was going through serious mental health struggles after losing my dad. But guess who they'll ask to run help them if the one relative they have buying them food gets sick?

If your in-laws are over 60 and/or have any medical conditions that increase their likelihood of dying they are doing exactly what they should be doing, them being home means they won‚Äôt be taking up a hospital bed any time soon. I don‚Äôt think that qualifies as dumb.

How exactly are your in-laws being dumb? I'm 35 and me and my kids have been locked in our house for a month getting our groceries delivered. If you're not an essential worker and you have the capability to stay home this is exactly what you're supposed to be doing right now.

I think the division lies with how confident people may be about their own health and odds. Those who don‚Äôt care usually seem to think it won‚Äôt hit them badly. People taking it seriously may have health histories or vulnerabilities they know make them at risk.

I think it also depends on how much research you feel comfortable doing. The more research I have done on this disease, the more optimistic I am that I am doing things correctly so as to minimize my chance (and my family's chance), of getting the virus, as well as minimize my risks for moving to the more severe phase of the disease and needing hospitalization. This does not mean I sterilize everything in reach with a flamethrower, but I do take all precautions that make sense: wear an N95 respirator and latex gloves when I go to a grocery store, go to the grocery store early in the morning, walk the dog for exercise and avoid people, wash my hands with the latex gloves on, then remove the gloves to dry for 8+ hours and then wash my hands without the gloves, etc.

That's fine, those things DO reduce your risk.

But those things do not eliminate that risk.

You're going to feel very differently about it when one stray virus particle sneaks through the side of your mask. And you'll have no idea how it happened.

Given the FDA approval of a Coronavirus vaccine will not happen until 2021, world economic depression is likely unless an approach other than vaccines is developed.

One such approach is UV disinfection using a single intravenous injection of 100 nm silver (or biodegradable) nanoparticles for patients already tested positive. The NP dose produces UVC radiation that disinfects the Coronavirus. No vaccines. See Paper and PR on "Coronavirus UVC Disinfection" at https://www.nanoqed.org

Isn't the more likely approach to slowly open up, keep enforcing the most effective preventative measures (washing hands, minimise social interaction), keep increasing healthcare capacity, keep sharing best practice treatment and accept the continued deaths?

‚ÄúEverybody else‚Äù separately spent only a few weeks inside so far, likely just like you. No one experienced the sum total of the collective time spent inside because we‚Äôre not separately all-powerful and knowing.

Saving lives is worth it, and right now we have to make sure the hospitals aren‚Äôt so overloaded that they can‚Äôt care for us, so if you‚Äôre not sick you need to stay healthy, and right now that means staying inside.

So your entire county has been closed since before the first county in America even suggested vulnerable populations consider self quarantine?

You can make your point without exaggeration since now it's difficult to trust any of the data you give.

Aside from that, only one county makes sense and their death toll makes the virus seem orders of magnitude more deadly than most people think, which means you're not testing enough, which means you're missing positive cases, which means you're missing positive deaths.

Do your math again in a few weeks.

Is it better to be be careful with this virus or to not care? Just stop wearing your seatbelt when you drive since there is a very low chance that you will get into an accident.

The 2008 economic collapse was caused by an incompetent banking industry. The 2020 economic collapse is being caused by an incompetent and unprepared healthcare industry. Why was everyone trying to crucify bankers in 2008 but we're literally applauding healthcare workers in 2020?

We failed to hold the people accountable in 2008 when the economy collapsed. We're going to make the same mistake 12 years later.

I think you need to clarify your point because these two events don't share much in common.

And I think you're confusing front line workers being applauded with those that run the hospital systems at the highest levels.

It's the same the whole world over, It's the poor what gets the blame, It's the rich what gets the pleasure, Isn't it a blooming shame?

For poor read the workers, for the rich read the management.

The healthcare system treats the sick. It's the governments job (through HHS and CDC) to prevent the pandemic. The government failed us, the healthcare system overall has done a pretty decent job handling the screw up of the government.

There hasn't been an economic collapse yet, we're just in a recession as a result of what's going on. What's going on isn't because of an incompetent and unprepared healthcare industry, at least not necessarily. I'd argue far more that this is a government failure more than anything else. Your average hospital doesn't need to be prepared for a full on pandemic as if one is going to happen every year, but the federal government should have plans, and supplies ready, or ready to be procured should one happen. The failure here (at least in the US) is a government one for sure. You could argue that the lack of free healthcare for all is also an issue, but that isn't the fault of doctors and nurses; the people we're applauding now.

The 2008 housing market collapse was due to greedy banks handing out loans like candy, to people who couldn't afford them, and then betting on it all as if everything was just rosy. Fast forward to now, Drs and Nurses are literally saving people's lives with what they have, and if they were to just step back, we'd be 1000x times more f***ed than we are now.

Did you even bother to think about what you had to say before you said it?

Which was required by government who was worried that poor people weren't able to buy houses.

Thats a gross misrepresentation of what happened. The real problem was caused when banks started repackaging the risky loans and reselling them as triple A. This is an oversimplification but the idea that this was simply due to a government program to allow poorer people to buy homes is just not true.

Other guy already said what I would have, but still, what does this have to do with comparing bankers and doctors? Doctors haven't done anything greedy here that's caused this. Quite the opposite, they're literally the ones helping to save us.

unprepared healthcare industry

I hate this thought. The healthcare system would have been under prepared regardless. Yes they are vastly under stock on PPE's and masks but the real issue is the lack of ICU space and Ventilators. Cant just magically make more hospitals whens theyre isnt a normal need for more hospitals coupled with the lack of ventilators there really wasnt much to be done. Also add the need for more nurses anyway.

There wasnt much the health care industry itself could have done. This time was ventilators, next time could be Dialysis machines.

What would you say the healthcare industry was specifically incompetent and unprepared about?

So they should always keep enough ventilators, beds, ppe and employees on hand for a pandemic disease? That's fantasy land thinking.

It would be to the detriment of care at any other time, the cost of care would rise so dramatically that no one except the rich would be able to afford basic care probably leading to more deaths than the pandemic you prepared for that never occurred.

Pandemic influenza is one of the highest risks on the UK government risk register. Many ‚Äúwar games‚Äù both in UK and USA have emphasised how much more should have been done to prepare. No one repaired the roof while the sun was shining.
