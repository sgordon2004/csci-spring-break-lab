As of April 17th, in the USA, 15% of confirmed cases are no longer active (either recovered or died.) Out of this 15 % (just over 100K) 37% have died. That most likely will not continue, but it's what the data tells us right now.

I'm not a troll. Do I think the numbers will go down? I sure hope so. However, with 15% of cases resolved those are the numbers. It's a snapshot. This is what the data says right now (well, as of Friday April 17.) The future forecast is based on simple multiplication assuming the changes mentioned in the piece.

The numbers will go down eventually yes, virus spread follows a normal distribution. It could be a while though, and eventually we’ll have to start making difficult decisions about the value of the economy vs human lives.

The number of deaths is reliant on the amount of people tested /traced, when the testing started, what country you live in, how much faith you want to put (in the USA at least) into a relatively small sample size, and how far out you want to go.

Let's say by some miracle the USA tests half the population by August first. That' 163 M folks. If the positive rate drops to 10 percent that's 16.3 M cases.Putting the infection fatality rate at 2.5 %, (as some have suggested above) that's just over 400,000 deaths by November 1st. The more people you test, the higher the number of positive cases, and (most likely) the lower the fatality rate. I wasn't trying to alarm anyone - what I posted was what the numbers say now, with 15% of positive cases in the USA resolved.

Putting the infection fatality rate at 2.5 %

It's closer to .5%, the best we can tell. Maybe even less- with good medical care. But that's also not taking into account the ever-growing anecdotal evidence of serious health effects like lung damage and kidney problems. Nor the fact rural regions are totally unequipped for this, and as this seeps more into those regions, more people will die.

I'm not freaking out. It's a data snapshot of where we are right now. Do I expect the numbers to change? I sure hope so - but right now, with just over 15% of identified cases resolved -- this is where we are. That's all.

So this isn’t directly Covid-19 related so skip if you want but I am facing a bit of a personal dilemma due to the pandemic I’d like to get some feedback on. I recently graduated college with a degree in Business Administration and when I secured a job I moved out of my parents place with only two months rent+expenses saved. When this all hit, my three month contract at my employer was not renewed when it likely was a foregone conclusion previously to re-new it as they closed most of their office. Due to how they treated me whenever they re-open I am not interested in going back. However, I’ve had trouble finding work on my own since, especially in my field of work utilizing my degree. (Small town WI).

My options are to either take up a local Post Office job I applied for recently which I know I won’t enjoy but might come close to paying my bills for the time-being, or take an eviction hit and move back in with my parents to look for a better position either locally or help save my money towards possibly moving to a bigger city and looking for work there. I feel like I’m wasting my time paying rent and bills to work a job I’m not interested in long-term in this rural setting. Thoughts?

I'd say suck it up and go back to the place that didn't renew your contract. Take the post office job in the meantime. Just my opinion though.

Thanks for the reply. I will give the Post Office job a try in the meantime to cover expenses and see where to go from there depending on the economy and job outlook as well as potentially finding a sublease.

If you have not yet, talk to your landlord. Tell them you lost your job and won't be able to pay and find out what the fees are really going to look like if you break your lease. No point making them evict you. This will give you more info to help you decide.

I believe it is two months rent + security deposit as outlined in my lease. I should probably look into subleasing if I decide to go that route.

Why is Coronavirus only killing people after being tested? The Corona death charts are people who died after testing positive, why? Why is it that there are no cases of untested people that were found dead in their homes and cause of death was Corona?

There are it’s called presumptive or probable deaths. That’s why NYC reported an additional 3,700 deaths on the 14th and Wuhan did the same thing on Friday.

The other factor here in the USA is that each state defines a COVID-19 death differently. For example, if you test positive for COVID-19, develop pneumonia while in the hospital and die - some states will attribute the death to pneumonia and others to COVID-19.

There has been thousands of them. Every once in a while you will see a spike in one of the country’s or states death total and that is because they are adding people that died in their home or at nursing homes of corona and were never tested.

I was just puzzled really about this, we got 53 death count in my country and about 3000 cases and one major problem raised was lack of testing, so i thought if we could have many cases untested why i have never. Thank you

Are there instances where the virus just stays with certain people? Looking at South Korea and Germany as two of the countries that supply honest data and have handled the virus very well with obviously different degrees of success I notice they still have a very large # of patient’s that have not recovered and are not in critical condition. Both countries especially South Korea are at the tail end of this first wave so I’m just curious....

Sorry but your statement does not support your question very well. Apparently the virus does not look at your passport before infecting you so certain country's situation has nothing to do with whether the virus stays with certain people. Just trying to explain why SK and Germany are different from others. If you handle it well, mild cases are more unlikely to turn critical.

We can actually see imported cases data from Australia and Singapore to see that US and Europe may have just as many if not more cases than China.

Let's look at Singapore first:

Total of 24 cases from China so far (all from Wuhan), while there are 178 from UK and 63 cases from US. https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/cases/search

3.41m Chinese visits Singapore in 2019 vs 0.64m Americans visit Singapore. UK isnt even on the list https://www.budgetdirect.com.sg/travel-insurance/research/singapore-tourism-statistics

First case detected from China is on 1/23 (Wuhan went into lock down on 1/23, Singapore blocked all visitors from China on 1/31) and first detected case from US and UK is on 3/23 (UK went into lock down on 3/23, Singapore blocked all visitors on 3/23).

Let's look at Australia next:

Just look at this graph to see the magnitude of the differences

There are more Chinese visitors than US and UK combined in 2019

In both countries we see significantly more imported cases from Europe and US than China despite having way less visitors. In addition, it looks like most of the cases in China are concentrated in Wuhan.

If we just look at Singapore's data, Europe, China and US all went into lock down around the same time as the first case was detected in Singapore, however there are already more cases from those countries when lock down happened. The only way Europe and US could have less cases is that they implemented tighter social distance measure than Wuhan.

We also see similar spike in cases for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan with similar spike in new cases in March (from US and Europe) compared to January and February (from China).

I’m getting exceptionally sick of this sub’s hate boner for Florida testing while praising California. Florida has been consistently testing at 11% positive and dropping, is middle of the pack for testing per capita, and is behind only NY in raw numbers of tests. The percentage of positive tests keeps dropping. The website only tracks cumulative positive percentages, but Dade and Broward were up to 20% positive and have dropped to 16% cummulative, so they have to be even lower than that currently. Hillsborough is almost at 6% cumulative after hitting a high of 7%. The hospitals aren’t overrun. We’ve done so many tests (in comparison to other states) that our mortality rate is one of the lowest.

It just seems like we’re in better shape than people want us to be. Here in Hillsborough county (where Tampa is), we had the earliest cases in the state and we’re still holding steady. To me, it looks like the early measures put in place by the counties and cities hit hard are starting to pay off.

In the same breath, people will say how happy they are about California’s response. Really? Why? They have one of the lowest testing positive rates and testing per capita. They have a ridiculous backlog of tests pending. I understand they’ve been proactive with their orders, but getting people to stay home is only part of the puzzle.

I'm in Broward and I'm from California. The reason Florida gets flack and California gets praise is because California is not a patchwork, Florida is. The govenor of California is taking the lead on this while our govenor is letting municipalities take the lead. This makes Florida as a whole look like a   show. Parts of florida are doing great with quarantine orders and testing, other areas mess. My city was one of the first in the county to order face coverings, close down non-essentials buisness, parks etc... my city hasn't seen the uptick in cases although we have our share. But areas like Jacksonville are going to see an uptick in a few weeks. It's not enough to only let people walk on the beach and not use facilities, they also need to limit how many people are on the beach. 6 feet of separation isn't enough when a sneeze can project 27 feet.

You haven’t actually responded to anything I said. The beaches aren’t open the way most people imagine them to be open. You cannot just go to the beach and spend the day there. You can exercise there. Parks have always been open for exercise, except the ones with sand.

Additionally, the death rate didn’t spike. The reported death rate saw a backlogged spike from the three-day weekend. The day before they didn’t even record any deaths in the evening update. Those deaths were adjusted back to the correct days. Our three-day Average (a great measure that Cuomo uses all the time), is still on a downward turn.

I don't need to imagine, I saw the photos and footage of people there when it re-opened and many weren't social distancing, and very few were wearing masks.

Ok, if you want to think Fl is magically protected by god or something, and none of this will have any effects, be my guest.

I don’t think Florida is immune or protected. I think this sub wants to see 30% of Florida’s population die. I think they want to imagine a world where we have a worse outbreak than NYC because lol The Villages and Spring Break. That isn’t going to happen. Florida is much better off than states that actually need attention, like Michigan and Massachusetts.

Dont bring your facts up in here. Florida is going to have more deaths than Italy because there are people out walking on a beach. They should all lockdown until at least a vaccine is made in 2022 and then a couple months afterwards just to be safe.

Don't let any of the idiots in this god-awful sub act like they hate Florida because of the governor. They hate Floridians with or without the governor. I've seen so much hatred in here and people hoping that Florida death count skyrockets. I think the fact that we are doing so well even after the spring beakers, late lockdown from governor, and now Jacksonville beach opening causes even more anger.

https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/g1ty3g/are_immunity_certificates_actually_feasible/ An expert on viral antibodies explains that even the best serology tests can offer as many as 82% of positives as false positives (sadly due to simple statistical math). Really puts a wrench on the plan of mass testing for immunity.

People that think stay at home orders will return after we phase in a reopening in the US: How are we supposed to economically survive that? Seems like people will go hungry at that point. Lord knows the feds won’t send another stimulus out.

Honestly, there is going to be a turning point when people realize the economy is more important than the lives it'll cost. Everyone is just going to have to be more careful, and practice distancing from older people.

It  f***ing sucks when you realize this. We all want to be as altruistic as we can be and brave enough to be able to be locked down longer for the sake of our vulnerable people.... but I can’t lie, the prospect of people rioting and going hungry is very terrifying to me. Only a matter of time if we were to “lockdown until vaccine”. Also, we like to say “no opening without very widespread and vigilant testing”.. but the clock is ticking even if we don’t get our testing up to par.  f***, this situation is very grim unless we pick up the pace.

I'm not in the "OMG OPEN IT ALL UP NOW" camp like a uh... certain... political persuasion. I think we've done a good job flattening the curve, but you're right there's a certain point on the graph between "economic consequence" and "health consequence" that flips which is the more serious of the two.

And, whether we're ready or not, that point isn't too far away. I'm hopeful in how successful we've been, and I'm desperately hoping that the experts find a way to allow some opening and keeping the curve as flat as possible as long as possible.

It's a false dichotomy that people will either starve in their homes because of economic consequences and because of that we need to open up the country again. We have enough food in this country that we could feed everyone until this ends. We have enough housing in this country that we could house everyone until this ends. We are the richest and most prosperous nation in the history of the planet, and we could pay everyone to sit at home and watch Netflix until this all blows over.

What we lack is political willpower and leadership to make tough decisions like mobilizing industries with wartime emergency powers to provide said food and commandeer said housing. If you want to preserve the modern American oligarchy, then yes, your options are to let people starve or to let them die from a virus. There are other options if you change the status quo.

I don’t think anyone is arguing that we don’t have the food or money. The problem is the people in poverty who won’t see those resources.

Do you have any suggestions as to what these options could be? I don’t think switching out of our American oligarchy is really an option in the time frame we are looking at. Unless you are just speaking on a bigger time line.

You can't force people to go shopping or go to movie theatres.

I've seen differing figures on this, but in the US roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of those 25-34 live with their parents. How do you propose they practice social distancing from them?

That last question is a big part of the problem. I don’t think anyone has a solution to that puzzle. I can also say a lot of people are working beyond 65-67. Not all of them are at work because they need the money. They’re doing it because they like the work. We’re going to see a lot of those people just retire. Especially if they work with kids.

Do a little math. How many people that age , say it's 1/4, live witht heir parents. Then figure out how many empty hotel rooms there are in the country. Then figure out where both of those things are located. Does that sound like a remotely viable solution

It's not going to be the only solution to prevent spread but it's one way a city is trying to mitigate that issue. We could fit about 200k people into empty hotel rooms in NYC fyi. That won't work for every family in your scenario, but it will help a lot.

Hotel rooms in NYC are already being used for quarantining people, because there aren't enough hospital beds. That's already sick people, 11,000 will be used as of now. California is going to be using 15,000 hotel rooms for the homeless. The math is already against you. Nevermind the cost, once its running into months. Or the fact the number of hotels in most areas is orders of magnitude fewer.

Now, take 1/4 of the number of people between 24-34 in the US, and do the calculations. It doesn't work, at all. Sorry.

If the numbers from NYC Health department are accurate than 75% of all COVID-19 deaths are people with “underlying conditions”. Maybe the way to start opening up this economy is to tell people with “underlying conditions” to stay self-quarantined and let everyone in the lower risk category go back to work first.

There’s one big problem. According to the CDC, as many as 1/3rd of all Americans have high blood pressure, and as many as 39% of adults over 20 are considered obese. Those are both underlying conditions here that can cause COVID severe reaction. Also death rate is not the only thing to look at, HOSPITALIZATION rate is the serious problem. 20% for most age groups. That means if 100 people get COVID 19 twenty of them will need to go to the hospital due to how sick they are.

We can’t just let this wash over us. Trump already asked the experts that very early on.

This disease is serious. If you let it infect a big portion of the population you’ll end up with millions of dead period.

So until their is a vaccine people at risk stay quarantined. People at low risk go back to work to keep the economy moving. Today we label everyone as essential or non-essential regardless of their health or underlying conditions. There is no 100% solution but let’s look at the stats and get those at lowest risk back to work and everyone else stay safe.

Your hospitalization rate figure is way off. Hospitalization rate is less than 20% even for the elderly. It’s practically zero under 20 years old and increases somewhat linearly with age from there.

What hasn’t been covered that much in western media is the explosion in cases in Singapore

Few weeks ago they had single cases, now it’s growing exponentially. Singapore had 300 new cases few days ago, now it’s 900 new cases per day.

Most of it is in the suburbs in the dormitories for workers that live in   conditions, 20 people in one room. It highlights the inequality in Singapore.

Does it seem a little hypocritical that some (heavy emphasis on some) people want to continue the quarantine so that people don't die. But when it comes to the topic of the protestors, they comment about how they hope those people die to learn a lesson or they hope doctors don't treat them.

The U.S. doesn't have a law that says you're put to death for being stupid. I think we can come up with less severe punishments for ignorance than "Well they won't be around to protest in 2 weeks anyway hehe."

No healthcare worker is going to deny treatment based on the patient's moral failings, people walk off the job over the lack of PPE is another matter. If we personally hate a patient for some reason we would request a change in assignment, and if the management say no we tough it out. This is to protect the patient from our inability to provide adequate emotional support and trusting relationship, not to protect us from patients we dislike.

My feeling is that the freedom to voluntarily infect yourself with a highly contagious somewhat deadly disease carries an implied responsibility to resolve the illness in isolation without putting others at risk. That the progress of the disease should be considered an indivisible integral unit as far as voluntary participation goes. You're free to infect yourself, but only yourself. If you want to accept that responsibility and exercise that liberty you need to commit to all of it, because otherwise you are harming other people. We can be quite free with "do what you want" until it conflicts with "if it harms noone".

In the vernacular specific to the group, "play stupid games, win stupid prizes".

That's reckless endangerment of medical personnel. A harm voluntarily done to key infrastructure in a time of crisis. A crime against society.

In an epidemic of this severity that practice leads to the treatment of voluntary participants at the cost of neglect of involuntary participants, as hospitals become overwhelmed. The volunteer harms or kills others by depleting the resources. That is not OK.

If you're going to volunteer, you need to own it all. Personal choice, personal responsibility.

I agree, however, these people are literally endangering other's lives so I get the frustration. Stupid as an excuse only gets you so far. If someone else is going to die because of them is it that wrong to prefer they die instead if the healthcare system doesn't have the capacity to save everyone? I don't know. I'm just spewing my thoughts. Lots of moral implications for everything that is going on.

In the US, and it feels really hard to get a sense of what's going on and where we are in the timeline of this. Trump and some states are talking about opening up the country, our death projections have plummeted, the mainstream news is still reporting that this is a doomsday event, and my social media is filled with people who apparently think that China engineered the virus and Bill Gates has a vaccine ready that will really inject us with microchips so the government can track us.

It is hard. Pretty much everything you said is true. Some states are in a decent position to open up in May. Our projected deaths have decreased. The media is still reporting it as a doomsday scenario because it still very much is. Even though our new cases are declining, there are still a lot of sick people and we’re still recording thousands dead each day. As for social media? It’s a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Always has been.

The reason you can't get a sense of what's going on is because we are completely random. Even cities in my same county are approaching quarantine differently. We absolutley have a possible doomsday event occurring if we start opening up soon, mostly because we are severely lagging in testing and don't have a clear picture of how widespread covid is. If we had widespread testing we could actually have a see what's going on and could conceivably slowly open up areas that have little to no infections. Even if we did that we would have to continue monitoring so we could re-close areas that start seeing an uptick. This would require a huge effort and we would have to limit travel between regions. The whole Bill Gates thing is so insane I can't even begin.

It won't be done nationally.

Also, let's not paint a false dichotomy accidentally. We're not going to flip a switch and put everything back to normal (at least I hope not). Remember the goal was to flatten the curve - not to eliminate all chance of infection. This virus is with us until we have a vaccine - period.

Now the challenge will be finding a balance between opening back up goods, services, and employment WITHOUT causing spikes that exceed healthcare capacity.

Most states right now have mostly empty hospitals. I'm in Richmond, Virginia, my wife is a nurse, and she hasn't worked in three weeks because they're asking for volunteers to stay home since the hospital just has so few patients. States on the west coast are laying off doctors and nurses because the hospitals can't afford to pay them without cash flow. We succeeded in creating room in the system to deal with critical patients as they happen, and now we just have to find out what level of loosening restrictions that is.

If we start slow, a couple weeks at a time, and measure the change, then we can likely strike a survivable balance that lasts until a vaccine goes public.

Unlikely to be airborne in most places, it can be airborne in a hospital because procedures like intubation release a huge amount of virus into the air. Outside of hospitals it primarily spread by droplet, but some of the droplets can be very fine and behave like airborne for a few hours. People who can keep distance is unlikely to be infected this way because the virus concentration in air is low. The virus degrade more quickly outdoors because airflow dries out its protective surface, keeping windows open is recommended where-ever possible. Take care

Thank you! I was concerned about if it still stays in the air for hours if someone asymptomatic coughs repeatedly in a room that has a window or door open. I guess it is a question with no 100% reliable answers...

A far fetched conspiracy theory but hear me out:

There has been an article in the UK newspaper The Times which is blaming the government and Boris Johnson for the current crises.

I agree Boris and the government have behaved shockingly and well below the expectation of the reasonable person.

But I believe it was mainly the committee of scientists including Chris Witty advising the UK government that has been negligent and to blame for the crises, since January.

They negligently advised Boris Johnson and the government about the severity and danger of the virus despite Ferguson from Imperial College trying to push the committee.

I now suspect that these scientists have been maliciously influenced by China in a similar way to WHO.

Can someone ELI5 how the original SARS virus just disappeared off the face of the earth on its own?

And is that at all a possibility for COVID-19? Why/why not?

I am not an expert in this, but apparently SARS1 was so deadly that it killed off it's hosts and limited its own spread, so it drove itself into extinction, it had a mortality of around 10% , I do not believe this will likely happen with covid as it has a lower mortality - probably closer to 1%, with a longer incubation period. Because it is less deadly, people are getting infected and feeling fine, and go around spreading it. This means the Covid virus will probably not die out the way SARs1 did.

It will likely get less deadly though. More severe strains will have a harder time spreading b/c if a person is really sick, they isolate quicker and prevent the spread. A milder strain that doesn't lead to many deaths will get passed around easier as people will think they have a cold and be on with their life, encouraging spread.

It may also evolve toward a longer incubation period because we are letting people out after 14 days, applying selection pressure. However, most experts are still saying that coronaviruses historically mutated slower than other viruses like influenza.

I believe the reason SARS was able to be effectively contained and near eradicated was because it was much easier to track and monitor than covid19. Covid-19 can have someone completely asymptomatic for up to 2 weeks, or potentially the entire time they have it. As such it's very hard to track who has it.

Hell, that study in California the other day pointed towards the possibility that the number of covid-19 positive people is 85 times higher than we expected.

I was wondering that too when Fauci said it on fox the other day. I don't believe a virus just disappears. Maybe its just spreading in very small, untracked areas around the world.

Idea: have some grocery stores require mandatory face covering and some do not, so that people who take the virus seriously can segregate themselves from those who do not.

Allow for hazard pay bonus to workers at the mask-less stores and protected hours for senior/immunocompromised people who cannot travel to masked stores.

Ah right, have you thought about splitting the hospitals into two - one for the stupid people who dont want to take it seriously, without any PPE. And one for the people who do take it seriously. Going by your logic this sounds like such a great idea... survival of the fittest, amirite ? :D

It would be difficult for me to provide medical care to Protestors of stay at home orders (for suspected COVID)... but that goes against our oaths.... right?

If they endanger others and ourselves, why are we required to care for them?

It would be, but I get where you're coming from. I don't agree with the idea that this is the same as a person who causes a car crash or uses drugs. This is more comparable to say a member of a hate group or a known drug dealer or murderer coming in and needing help.

You'd probably still help them, even if difficult to do.

I hope these idiots just realize how quickly this virus spreads and stay home.

Yes but most of them did not land themselves there after being repeatedly told that it is risky and could get their families/neighbors/healthcare workers killed. We also normally get enough PPE to protect ourselves. I would treat a protester like any other patient if one landed in my unit. But if s/he infected anyone else I will be pissed. And if that protester try to tell me I signed up for this I would ask for a change of assignment and care for a different covid patient, we have a right to that too.

Look, the reality is that very few of us will ever really know how any specific person got infected and how much their beliefs had to do with their illness.

There will be Trump voters who go to anti-lockdown protests, wear a mask at the protest, don't get it at the protest, and get it from something unrelated and seemingly safe the next day, just through bad luck. There will be people who selflessly do food deliveries and charity stuff to help the victims of this pandemic, who get it at the Salvation Army as a direct result of trying to help.

We gotta be intellectually humble and not pretend we know more than we really do.

It’s the fact that experts and doctors said stay at home. Stay 6 feet (or more) away from people. It’s the trauma I feel looking at photos of people shoulder to shoulder at protests with their various signs stating something or other about “open the state/country, allow us to leave our houses normally.” And then the idea that if these people get sick, they still want to come and be treated under the knowledge of that same group of medical experts and doctors and other healthcare workers. And we don’t have adequate or safe PPE. It’s the fear that allowing greater public exposure is a top priority for some—while there’s still not enough hand sanitizer or masks. Healthcare workers are always at risk (our lives, our babies lives), but in this pandemic we’re at much greater risk and some of that risk is preventable.

If they protested while wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from others I am actually entirely ok with that. I think the right to assemble is important, you just have to meet the minimum standards. I have looked after a few hospitalized prisoners who committed crimes and I had good therapeutic relationships with them. I have also looked after Trump supporters and they are good people with values different from my own, I belive I give them the same care and support as anyone else. But the truth is we will never treat all patients the same. Some you grow fond of and will go out of your way for. If I intensely dislike a patient for whatever reason, I will meet my minimal standards and no more. And by meeting minimal standards I mean not just safe quality care but also meeting their needs for emotional support and trust. If I think I might fail at the minimal standards I will request a change in assignment.

This kind of attitude is what's wrong with the world today.

It's the same thing the right and left do, they turn the other person into something less than "us" . Something not worthy of the same care as "us". Someone who doesn't deserve life like "us". Dehumanizing others is a pretty slippery slope as history has shown.

So am I right in thinking this.

Most of the world is trying their best to social distance but America just isn’t.

And there’s no point opening things up until everyone has reached a level, which America don’t reach?

It’s like behind held behind after school and America keeps whispering so the teacher adds 10 minutes.

And it’s like “hey we are all being quiet” but the teacher is mrs corona she gives no  f***s. America misbehaved and you all get extra time.

Lol yeah this sub is too much. The USA is  f***ed, everything is terrible here and so much better every where else in the world. It's hard to say if its Chinese and Russian bots posting this crap or every 20 year old whiny liberal sees a few people on the beach and immediately thinks this. We had 200k deaths originally estimated and it's been revised down to 60k because our social distancing is far better than expected.

We have 5% of the world's population and 25% of the total Covid-19 cases and deaths. If that isn't an indictment on our current administrations ignorance and sheer ineptitude while [not] handling this crisis... I don't know what is.

And now he's inciting his base to riot in their states for the honor of spreading it even more... just so he can score a few political points. It's monstrous.

No, we have 25% of the cases that have been confirmed in a lab and admitted by governments. You really think the U.S. is going to end this with more actual cases than India or Africa? Be serious. Others are either not testing, or they're lying, or both.

The U.S isn't even testing properly. You sound foolish to compare us to India or countries is Africa, both of which have extremely limited resources compared to the U.S.

The federal government dropped the ball in a major way by treating each state like their own individual country. Certain governors are doing the right thing, while others aren't. This could have been much better controlled, but clearly, death is less important then the artificially propped up stock market or the upcoming election.

I don't blame the presidency for the virus, but I blame him and his administration for not taking it serious at first, the cdc for the delay in testing, and fema for once again not responding quickly to certain states that need help.

This whole response has been an absolute failure and we have nearly 40,000 dead because of it.

Yes, I really do think that the U.S. is going to have the most deaths + cases in the world. India may not be as developed as the U.S, but they do not have an insane orange idiot leading their country (or people stupid enough to listen to him).

Depends entirely on your argument. Do you have reasonable evidence to base it on, like the urn pickup numbers? If they know more about the situation an you are just speculating without grounds the n they might be appropriate to criticize you. If you have valid arguments they should criticize the arguments, not you.

I live in NY and my friend just texted a group chat with a bunch of friends that “Corona is finally going away!” I asked for sources and she said she heard it on the news. I haven’t watched the news in a few days because it gets depressing especially because I was obsessively reading and watching everything about COVID for 3 weeks and had to force myself to stop. Anyway, I told her it was hard to believe but fingers crossed. I also said it worries me that the media may be putting this out there because of the government (specifically Trump) wants people back to work for the economy and I hope they wouldn’t tell us it’s safe just to get us back to work. Also- keep in mind our SAHO was extended to May 15. Everyone is coming at me like I’m being “so negative” and being a “Trump hater”. Let me be clear, I know there will be an end to this all and I am not naive to think this will last forever. I just don’t see the virus “going away” over the weekend. Am I the asshole here or could this be true? Any other NYers have any inclination on when this will end?

Honestly I’d be annoyed about your friend too! I’m in New Jersey where it’s pretty bad too, and I get that people want to move on and start going out again, but I do feel like there’s a rushed sense of urgency that may hurt rather than help. I also agree that the virus is not going to just “go away” although I’m hopeful that we will be able to reopen during summer... not sure though and I’m no doctor. I also believe that NY and NJ will be the last states to reopen

April 18 Updates

Incorporated April 14 to April 17 data

Cumulative positive percentage (CPP) decreased from 19.7% to 19.5%

Overall trend continues

The plateau in new cases per day (around 30,000) seems to be limited by how many tests are performed.

Simply put, if tests are limited to 150,000 with 20% positives a plateau is hit at 30,000 new cases a day.

The table below shows how this tracks with the last 19 days of US historical data on testing from https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily

The cumulative positive percentage (CPP) is calculated as the most recent Positive / Total Tests (694,520 / 3,557,493 = 19.5%).

Estimated Cases (Est Cases) is calculated as that day's New Tests x CPP.

The daily positive percentage (DPP) is calculated as that day's New Cases / New Tests and shows how consistently these two statistics are related.



Date    Positive  Negative   Total Tests  New Tests  New Cases  Est Cases  DPP

This highlights the importance of widespread, large-scale testing. Without it:

New cases appear to plateau leading to a false sense of security

Deaths are undercounted due to undiagnosed cases

Projection models are less accurate (garbage in garbage out)

So do you all want to here something crazy going on in my town that’s straight out of a movie or something?

So there’s a dozen or so cases in my town that we discovered all came from our local medical clinic (it’s a pretty small town and word travels fast). Apparently the guy who owns the place (who also happens to be the head doctor) doesn’t require masks or sanitation after patients leave. The health board shut down his clinic after his own son (who is also a doctor at the clinic) reported it. According to a Facebook post by the son, all 12+ cases of Covid came from 2 nurses who are infected that the head doctor (his father) refused to order to stay home and knowingly kept them on the schedule, even firing 2 non-infected nurses that his son tried to give shifts from the infected nurses to. Right now there are multiple people from the local court going through the files kept at the clinic searching for evidence that can be used in a wrongful death suit that’s apparently being drafted by the husband of one of the elderly patients that got infected at the clinic and died a few days ago.

 f***ing insane.

Hey, I want to ask americans. How are some people already claiming that things are getting better for the US? I'm in Spain, Madrid, and we have very very strict lockdown since March (Spain and Italy being the ones that took it more seriously), and we are improving but not near the end yet. How americans are claiming victory already? If you look at this graphic (go to 'La evolución del brote en los países más afectados' and look at Estados Unidos) you can see that most of your cases are still active and havent resolved yet. Is this graphic wrong or am I missing something?

Trump cannot be charged with State level crimes while he is president. If he loses the Federal election this year, he has several State charges awaiting him. He has a lot of incentive to tell the US public that things are going as well as they can possibly go under his leadership.

Day 1: Scratchy throat , small dry cough

Day2: sore throat, worsening dry cough, headache

Day3: sore throat, dry cough, migraine, fever

Day4: horrendous pulsating migraine, body aches, nausea, high fever, throat got better , cough less frequent

Day5: persistent headache, congestion, fever gone, small infrequent cough, chest pains

Has the "flattening the curve" strategy slowly changed in the US? My understanding is that the point of "flattening the curve" was to minimize the number of hospital visitations so that health care workers don't get overwhelmed (which, according to the IHME model, we've done). But now I'm listening to officials talk about it as if the point was to eliminate coronavirus spread entirely. What gives?

It is quite simply. Coronavirus kills people. Coronavirus is bad. Hence talking about killing coronavirus sounds good to politicians.

And the current situation in the US seems to be chaotic right now. Around 150 000 tests are performed daily. Out of these around 30 000 are positive. That is 1 in 5, or 20%. Common number in other countries is around 5%. This could indicate that labs are processing serious cases first and testing is insufficient. If there was enough testing capacity, the numbers might still be growing exponentially.

The amount of deaths reported is also questionable and hard to compare between countries. For example in Belgium they do count anyone who dies at home or in nursing home from pneumonia, without testing them. If the backlog of such deaths is counted in the US properly, the numbers might become more bleak than they look now.

The protective equipment situation also is not good and if things go at the current pace in the more heavily hit parts of the US, they might run out, causing more spikes. And people who have their lungs damaged do tend to stay in hospital for 4+ weeks, so it can add to the current load still. I think the situation still needs some 2-3 weeks of observation to claim that the curve has been flattened in the US.

The amount of hate I'm seeing in different posts in this subreddit is concerning to me. I don't think anti-Chinese insults, demands to arrest everyone at WHO and lamenting about media bias are a particularly constructive way to talk about COVID-19.

Well there’s under control and there’s under control.

A car rolling down a hillside on fire isn’t under control.

A car with a sober, competent driver at the wheel is under control.

A race car with a skilled driver pushing the limits on a racetrack is under control, but it takes very very little for that to change to a huge wreck.

We’re a bit too close to the racetrack case right now.

We haven’t gone out anywhere and been home but then again we live in a building. So who knows how we got sick maybe elevators having to wash clothes get our package. If you can take the stairs do it if your live in a building. I want to share this with y’all.

Day 1 - scratchy throat

Day- 2 blocked right ear and lots of wax coming out.

Day 3 - fever and body started aching

Day 4- coughing, aches, sweating

Day -5 fatigue,symptoms of day 1-4 combined with 5

On day - 4 my wife’s starts experiencing my symptoms except for the ear thing. Cough is brutal on her. Her weight is making this thing tougher on her. She is older than I am and has apnea. Can’t use her machine because the cough loves tickling the back your throat to cough.

Day 6 energy is low with symptoms.

Day 7 start to feel better to get tested and failed.

Day 8 relapse

Day 9 feeling better again to get tested. Result positive.

Quarantine until improvement

Day 10 -15 no energy and on the way to recovery day 16

I didn’t take any medication for this virus because I didn’t want to feel like  . My wife needed medication. Chloro drug was recommended to my wife. Boy she regretted taking that thing. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and mild fever side effects.

During my symptoms all my body wanted was liquids. I had to muster energy from somewhere to care of me and my wife. She couldn’t do anything. I found the energy but felt like   for 5 hours or more after. These are the things I did to help the both of us.

Steaming in the bathroom Orange and apple juice Soups and tones of soup Ginger tea in morning and night. This helped get that junk of our chest. Clean sheets and proper ventilation because the heat didn’t help.

I didn’t take any medication at all my wife needed it. Everyone’s body is different and may react differently. This is not a virus that anyone should joke around. I see why it kills many with health issues and older folks. I had to wake up every 2-3 hours to make my wife can breath because of apnea. She couldn’t use her machine because it would irritate her chest. But we pulled through. You know what’s the saddest part of it all we couldn’t see our son for 3 weeks. Stay safe out there y’all I just wanted to share this.

Seems to be a ton of misinformation and confusion on here so I'm just gonna leave this:

Flattening the curve never, ever was intended to mean "we wait 30 days and the virus packs up and goes bye". Flattening the curve meant we were at a point 6 weeks ago caught with our tail between our ass. We had an infectious disease with no prevention that wasn't very fatal if helped, but did require some medical intervention to help in many, even young healthy people. If everyone got it in the same month, we wouldn't have enough medical supplies to give everyone that basic medical intervention. Deaths go up without that IV or oxygen tank available quickly.

So we shut down to drag it out. Make the spike longer instead of higher. We can't stop the disease. We know that. That's not the plan. We just want that rush of everyone getting it in 30 days to drag out more to like 90 days. So factories have 90 days to make supplies, and we have people leaving hospitals when others arrive, we have time for doctors to recover if they get sick and bring in substitutes on a cycle, and we have more than a month to figure out what combats it best.

If we open up now or open up without caution then surprise, the disease spreads again and we are right back to where we were. We shut the economy down and sat at home a month for no reason. We wasted all our time and resources and the worst case scenario happened anyway. The time to make the debate was before the shutdown and before we already went into financial ruin. We chose lives. Done deal.

Do you really think they would be paying federal unemployment for 16 weeks and planning a 4th stimulus/relief bill for May if they knew this would be resolved in 6 weeks? We can't test everyone yet, we are no better equipped to treat a peak, people are still getting sick faster than fully recovering and we don't have a solid treatment plan or prevention method. Once those things are in place, ok yeah, we can open up. But we gotta at least give it the 10 weeks like China did. C'mon people.

One thing that being on this reddit for the last 4 weeks has shown me is that people don't understand what they read. Or maybe they're just only getting their information 3rd-hand and don't know how to check it out themselves.

People's critical thinking capability is disappointing.

Interesting observation today when I went shopping at Costco. They had put out several pallets of freezers the kind you would probably put in your garage or a spare room and I watched as people quickly went up and within an hour had taken around 24 freezers off the pallets to purchase. I asked one of the shoppers why he was buying it. His answer, “ I don’t trust anything the government has told me on this virus. They said it only affects old people...young people got on ventilators, they said don’t wear masks they are no good, and now wear them. They said it’s like the flu and it’s not like the flu. They said it’s contagious only when you have symptoms now they are asymptomatic people. They said wipe down your groceries now they say you don’t need to wipe them down. It’s not in the air it’s on surfaces now it’s in the air. I have to prepare that this could come back again worse and I’m not going to be looking for food and supplies.” People around him agreed. The lady next to him said “I trust taking care of myself more. I don’t believe anything that they tell us anymore.”

Food panic buying is still going on and there have been major disruptions in the food supply chain. People are seeing fresh produce that they don't normally see (like commercially packaged loose bananas and eggs at market) and prices for out of season foods have gone up (limes were $2/ piece due to citrus disruption).

The Smithfield pork processing plant hot spot went national and people are a bit freaked. I bought 5 pork tenderloins from smithfield from jewel the other day at a 90% discount (~>$2/ piece when they cost around $15-20 normally). I did this not as a survival tactic, but it was just too cheap to pass up and I own several deep freezers already as I'm in the food industry.

The panic cycle will continue and it feeds upon itself like Ouroboros.

NYC covid death statistics: Total of 3 deaths out of 6840 under age 18 (all with underlying conditions). 137 of the 6840 deaths were in people known to have no underlying conditions. 309 of the 6840 death in patients under 45. 5151 of 6840 deaths were in patients known to have underlying health conditions.

Still no effort is made to target prevention efforts towards the older and sicker.

Wait, you're telling me you're not interested in what law a local michigan representative proposed? Huh. Or which Florida beaches are going to open up?

I get that this site is about 50-60% American. But man. Americans really care about themselves to an extreme degree, in the context of a global pandemic. Before it hit America this subreddit was about Korea, China, Italy, Iran, Spain, Germany, Australia, Norway, Japan.

Have there been any studies on the impact of initial viral contact in eventual viral load and case severity?

In other words, if you only have contact with few viruses initially, does that correlate with your case being less severe than if you stood unprotected in a hospital room saturated with airborne viruses?

While you're buying surgical masks, properly check them . I bought a pack of 50 yesterday off Amazon and there was no meltblown filter in them. The masks are fake and you handkerchief is far better than what they sold me. I made a video about identifying them so watch if you want to.

My english a little bad so please don't be rude in comments.

Let me share with you guys some news from less known countries. I am from North Macedonia.

We have 1170 confirmed cases and over 10k tests done. ~400 of those are in my city and the rest scattered in the other cities. We have an unusually high death toll of 46 people across all age groups which is very worrying.

Our country did a lockdown (cafes, schools, restaurants) on the 11th of March with only 3 cases, but we somehow failed to stop the spread. We are currently celebrating Orthodox Easter in a 85 hour police curfew and we have those from 4pm till 5am the next day except weekends where we are not allowed to leave the house for anything except a medical emergency. Just going outside on the street is punishable by fine or jail depending on your offense.

Our state started a public mask mandate today. Anybody know of an American store strictly enforcing a "must have mask mandate". I went into a large gas station today, and the sign on the door said "Please don't enter without mask". A few customers ignored, walked in without a mask, and I heard the employees just mumbling about it under their breath. Could/would a retail store toss someone out for lack of mask?

Depends on the manager.

I’ve been wearing a mask for a month; if I was still managing a retail store and had a sign on the door I would politely ask those without masks to leave.

If they didn’t leave my next call would be to the cops. In my state you can forcibly remove trespassers off your property, this varies state to state. I’d go grab some eye protection and find a way to remove said trespassers.

I was exposed to the coronavirus and I have symptoms. I am from new jersey where the virus is widespread. I tested negative after being swabbed at an UrgentCare site, and my pulmonary doctor said there could be a 25% false negative and that I should assume I have it. I was wondering if anyone else had this same scenario or knows anything else about false negatives?

I have a family member who tested negative and then tested positive at a later date. She is still running a fever after a month or so. Her breathing is awful too, but I should add she has quite a few medical issues. I have heard that false negatives are an issue throughout this talking with some doctors I worked with in the past. Best wishes and I hope you feel better.

People in my country are already protesting against the government and want to return back to their normal life, even though restrictions were put into place for another 6 weeks. They keep bringing up stats like already same amount of people have died to regular flu this year and things like most of the people who die are over 80 years old so they already had a great life. Also, their main point is how this will stay for a long time so let nature choose the "strongest" and kill the rest, which just makes me sick.

A month into this whole situation and you can see how a lot of the people are very nervous about not getting their regular income, not being able to pay rent, food, gas and so on, they are so scared and that makes them do irregular things.

Also the fact that usually if a person has made up their mind, it is very difficult to change that, so as more people are protesting to get back to their normal lives, more will join and I'm finding it super hard to explain to them how this is a bad idea.

No matter what your opinion of the situation, if you read this and thought "Yea, the people who disagree with me are too stubborn to accept other view points" then remember that they think the same thing about you. When you hear new information, take a moment to reflect on why you dismissed it. Was it not credible or did it disagree with you so you didn't bother looking into it?

So I have a serious and personal question:

My school is supposed to start again on the 27th this month because I am in a class that's close to graduation. Our teacher now informed us that we can't be forced to come if we are part of especially endangered groups (immunity weaknesses etc.) or if we have contact to members of such groups daily because we live with them. As part of endangered people he also says that generally includes everyone above the age of 60.

Now to my question: Both of my parents are fairly healthy but both of them are also in their mid-sixties. I absolutely don't want to endanger them any more than they already are. Is it reasonable for me to stay at home because of this? And before anyone thinks this is about me not wanting to go to school or something I can say that's definitely not it - our final exams are coming up next month and we lost so much time that students usually get to practice for them that I want to get as many lessons with teachers and classmates as I can get before then. Whether I go to school or not changes nothing about my participation in the final exams either way.

TLDR:
I am supposed to go to school soon since I am close to graduation but my parents are both in their mid-sixties. Would you recommend me to stay at home or am I silly to worry about this so much?

New Zealander here.. We've been on strict 'level four' lock down for four weeks, tomorrow we find out if we can go to level 3... Still very restricted, but a few services reopen. To be honest, it is horrifying seeing Americans protesting in crowds, and the number of cases skyrocketing. What am I missing? Do Americans believe getting a haircut or eating out is more important than saving lives? I am so confused by Americas unclear approach to this.

It sucks a lot, and I think the thing about America that makes it all the more tougher is that so many Americans are jobless without a safety net to keep them afloat as we don’t have things like universal healthcare. We’re a hardworking nation that believes in individual sustainability and a lot of our citizens already have great distrust for government, and with a 1/3 of us being out of work imo it’s a lot less about getting haircuts and more about us being able to feed our families. I find a lot of the criticism very understandable even if it’s a better idea to be locked down.

Can someone explain why grocery stores are still all bought out with empty shelves? It’s been over a month now where I live since panic buying started and if there truly isn’t a disruption in the supply chain, why are all the shelves still barren? Isn’t there only a certain amount that people can stock up on before their supplies are maxed out? It’s not like people are eating more...

Given how much people are losing their marbles in the US due to inability to work, it really highlights how devastating it will be when automation really starts to replace jobs en masse. Already happening in other parts of the world. And honestly, I think this virus is going to accelerate the pace of automation since nobody will want to be in contact with others anymore. I don't think anyone will be working checkout lines in the future, and shopping will be a totally contactless experience. Deliveries too. Transport.

If you think things are tough now, I suggest you make sure you job is completely future proof. Ideally something in tech.

Can someone with more mathematical knowledge explain to me what are the odds that we get nearly 30k cases every day for over a week? Is this logical or is it 100% due to the fact that we have maxed out testing? If that’s the case, why are all politicians and media acting like we’ve peaked and the virus is under control?

I’m just a random person but to me it seems exceptionally odd that we have almost exactly 30k cases everyday and everyone just accept it as peaking.

Can anyone reconcile studies that suggest inferred extremely low mortality rates (Santa Clara, US) with the high mortality vs. population in cities like New York, Madrid and Northern Italy? By my math .125% of the entire population of NYC have died from coronavirus

Based in everything you have seen what do you think the true average mortality rate is? I’d say .5-1% seems likely. In New York something like 800K people must have been infected.

Mass testing, aggressive contact tracing, everyone wears masks and practices social distancing, slowly re-open economy and do soft localized shut downs at hot spots. Rinse and repeat until vaccines are available.

Will preempt this by saying I really am speaking out beyond my knowledge base here. But here goes:

Seems like this disease is more vascular in nature than pulmonary, as evidenced by diabetics, CHFers, and hypertensives— all people with underlying vascular disease— seemingly being more at risk of dying than people with chronic lung issues. This is surprising given that our managements have mostly been focused on the management of respiratory status. But what if the respiratory issues were not the primary disease process, but were more of a secondary result of a different process that could be acted upon more preemptively?

Since the virus enters via the ACE-2 enzyme, which may be involved in the body’s systems that regulate blood pressure and blood vessel construction and dilation like the ACE-1 enzyme is (the RAAS system), it makes me wonder if we should preemptively be treating these patients with medications that prevent systemic vasoconstriction (hydralazine?), which seems counterintuitive when you consider that many of these patients ultimately end up needing vasopressors. And what about preemptively administering blood thinners to prevent microthrombosis from occurring, as this may be the reason people are going into respiratory, renal and hepatic failure? Seems SUPER risky and would be well beyond any of our current guidelines for those meds. But, it may be a risk worth taking. Vasoconstriction and thrombosis could explain some of the weird skin manifestations of the disease, too.

Obviously medicine is a constantly evolving field. I just pray that we figure out even a relatively effective treatment plan soon, since throwing everything including the kitchen sink doesn’t seem to be working very well right now.

Mask shamers are the worst. "Why would you wear a mask in x place or during y time", idk maybe because it makes them feel better or it's appropriate for a situation you hadn't considered ya dip? Leave people alone, you think the only time to wear a mask is when you're actually coughing in someone's face? Just stop. You're such a drain. You never have anything useful to say, only negativity for the people actually doing something.

France has not published the number of infected people for two days in a row.

Right now, all the French (government financed) media are focusing on is the number of "hospitalized" people which has been going down for four days in a row, so they can re-open the economy asap.

Since the beginning, they have been lying, and minimizing the crisis. For example, they have only been counting deaths which happened in hospitals.

They are now pushing it a bit further. Covid-19 trackers have been showing +0 for two consecutive days.

Is France still a democracy?



EDIT: 3rd day in a row... +0 in tickers, no numbers in the news anymore. They focus on positive things, they seem to be in a hurry to reopen the economy, even thought the situation keeps getting worse.

NYPD testing is probably a lot different than a doctors test.

If you go get checked for cancer at a doctor, they wont call you and say "welp you have cancer". They will call to arrange another appointment.

If you do or do not have Covid, this is the best possible outcome for you. You actually can see a doctor.

If you aren't showing symptoms and have it they will probably just ask you questions of where you have been who you have been in contact with, then issue a 14 day quarantine.

If you do have it and are showing symptoms, then you will be in the best place to be in, a hospital.

I keep seeing people complain that the quarantine is going to last longer because people keep going to social gatherings. I might be wrong, but wouldn't proper social distancing actually extend the quarantine? It would obviously save lives but it "flattens the curve" which by definition extends the breakout and quarantine measures. If everyone just went by as normal the infection would spread super fast and the whole thing would be over quicker. I'm not advocating to end the social distancing measures, I just don't get why so many people think people breaking social distancing are the ones extending the quarantine.

Does anyone plan on living like this for the foreseeable future? I’ll be out the second I can be but can’t see my mom going to a restaurant, large event or whatever probably till there’s a vaccine. Probably will never leave the country again. People forget the mental impact this has

Question: we've been told the masks dont stop us from getting coronavirus but prevents others from getting it. Why do the masks stop things from going out but not coming in?

The IHME projections have been updated again and there are a few notable changes:

US total deaths have decreased from around 69K to around 60K

The main page disclaimer is now "Current social distancing assumed until infections minimized and containment implemented"

A containment strategy has been added to each state's projections. For instance, Pennsylvania's is:

After June 1, 2020, relaxing social distancing may be possible with containment strategies that include testing, contact tracing, isolation, and limiting gathering size.

This appears to suggest dates that each state can enter phase 1 of the new White House guidelines on reopening the U.S. The dates in the containment strategies range from May 4 (Hawaii, Montana, Vermont, West Virginia) to June 29 (Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota).

CNN is stating right now that anyone getting close to Pence or Trump gets a rapid test prior to meeting with them. Yes, there are plenty of tests for the people who matter to Trump. This is an outrage if true. Walk the talk Mr. Tough and go out in public to the same standards you preach. Otherwise list a disclaimer that states you are bubble boy but everyone else should just take a risk you won’t take.

I've always assumed that Trump is being tested regularly, possibly even every day, and also that everyone he meets is tested, contact traced to some extent and temperature checked etc. Wouldn't surprise me if his close relatives are being regularly tested too.

Any mask recommendations from glasses wearers? I tried the folded up square of cotton and a bandana pulled up over my nose and both just cause my glasses to fog up completely. I am looking at a few online but they seem like they would just do the same.

I am usually trying to tie my textile mask tightly at the top... and I include copper wire in the top of mine to shape it around my nose. If you let the bottom a bit more loosened up and mind your breathing a bit, most of the hot air escapes downwards, instead up to the glasses.

Does anyone else feel like the quarantine went from flattening the curve to try to lower new infections to 0? I’ve been going on walks with my mom (taking the right precautions and always staying 6 ft away from anyone) but my parents saw in the news today that people shouldn’t leave their houses at all cause the virus stays in the air...I feel like the media is now trying to create panic and scare people now

Huh? I think the goal is to lower the amount of new infections. Not to bring them down to zero. Even Trump says this has to happen over the course of several weeks straights to really reopen the country. So far the number of new cases is not going down.

Yeah, the daily thread specifically exposes this. It's interesting from a sociological standpoint. There are clear cliques, obvious waves of 'certain ideology' posters that roll in, post the same misspelled nonsense, upvote each other, downvote everyone else, and roll out.

Rinse and repeat.

'We must reopen the country', 'everything is fake', 'Bill Gates conspiracy', 'oh the economy', 'manufactured in a lab', it's fascinating how these all took root almost simultaneously and there's barely any cross-contamination, that usually the individual wackos just support the one but not all the others.

This isn’t an answer to your questions but tests don’t tell you if you are safe:

There’s a ~30% chance of a false negative when you’re positive.

They’re a snapshot in time, you can test negative Friday but end up with COVID on Monday.

Be careful with how you interpret test results.

Also the false negative and false positive rates differ widely based on what test one takes. Rapid blood tests seem to be the worst ones right now. Most reliable appear to be swab tests from waaaay back in someone's nose. As the medicine textbooks used to say around here... if the person does not have tears in their eyes, you aren't poking deep enough. This should be done only by medical staff.

We've just got our first new case here in the Faroes since the 6th this month, we are also for the first time since this all started down to single digit active cases after a high of 102 on 23/3.

So things are looking bright and such, but at the same time things are fragile, as it only takes one undetected to slip through

I know a healthy, active 40-year-old who is currently having his entire right leg amputated at the hip due to complications of coronavirus. He has been on a ventilator in a medically induced coma. He has flatlined and been resuscitated. He was on an ECMO machine and it was causing clotting in his right leg. Blood thinners were causing his blood pressure to plummet, so they had no choice but to stop them and amputate.

He has a 10-month-old son. Stay the  f*** home, y’all.

Reality is that you are probably not going to be able to reason with your mom. People tend to be stuck in their ways, or viewpoints in this case. It sucks, I know. If you have already stated your concerns then you have done enough.

Good luck to you and your family.

Has anyone else experienced ridicule or confusion for being young but concerned about the virus? I am getting flack for expressing concerns not just for my parents (who are healthy but almost 60) but also for myself. People say “you’re young, you’d be fine” and then part of the protections in the CARES act says your job has to give you leave if you live in a household with someone who has a note from a doctor saying they’re high risk. My job is debating right now if I can take leave or not because my family isn’t high risk. Everyone who is dying can’t be high risk people though correct? I hope this makes sense, I’m just worried but most people around me act like I shouldn’t be.

Our local urgent care has an antibody test.

Is that something that’s worth getting? I didn’t think any approved tests were available yet. Is it real or did they fall for a scam?

We were mildly sick at the beginning of March. Had lingering dry coughs for a few weeks and we’re finally better now. I’m curious if it was a mild case of COVID-19.

ETA- just saw a post from them saying it’s the same test Santa Clara county is using in the study they’re doing. It’s probably not worth it for us- don’t want to risk exposure if we haven’t had it. Insurance also doesn’t cover the test and because of this whole thing we’ve got about $4 to last us all of May 🙃so not quite enough to purchase a test.

States will decide. The North East and West coast states have created a pact where they will coordinate their reopenings. Other states will take their cue from the President, though the medical exports will push strongly to make the criteria more rigorous than that.

some states are better at that than others. my advice for them would be to contact literally every local news and tv station with their story along with OSHA, the city council, local business boards, congressman, governor, senators, etc etc etc and the former staff of that place who quit can make their full time job to get the business shut down and/or themselves rehired with backpay

At the moment we’re doin okay. The largest provinces have the largest outbreaks but we’ve been aggressive in our shutdowns and we’ve been ramping up testing as fast as we can.

I live in Alberta, we’ve opened up testing a fair bit so we had a large jump in cases today and yesterday, that’ll likely continue for a while as the number of tests we do goes up.

Overall our healthcare system is doing okay, we’re staying under capacity. The real problem is in our old age care homes where this thing is wreaking havoc. It’s clear we’ve not done enough to protect and care for our elderly.

In a word, ventilation.

If you closed all the windows in an apartment complex, connected all the apartments with central air conditioning, and had it running 24/7 through shoddy filters, and on top of that had every resident congregate in giant dining halls for each daily meal, you'd have the same exact petri dish situation.

I'm guessing this has been covered A LOT, but is there statistically significant random sample about COVID-19? Why not choose people from different places and check them for COVID-19 and antibodies. With enough samples you should be able to estimate infection rates and percentage of asymptomatic, recovered and not exposed yet. With all of the talk about removing SIP, it seems like getting a better sense of where we are would be prudent.

The lack of available testing and need to self isolate has made it slow to get a statistical sample done. But it would sure help make the models better.

Random thought... blood banks should offer free testing for #coronavirus antibodies when you make a donation. It would be a win-win. They get much needed blood for their supply and you get to find out if you have antibodies. #COVID

No, not all of them.

Maybe certain places can reopen at lower capacity. You're fire rated for 100? You can tape off every second and third seat and reopen for 33. Checkerboard the tables and keep people apart.

Hair, nail, beauty salons will be able to reopen with recovered/immune staff. Once the staff is immune, you only need to worry about protecting customer from customer, and it gets much more doable.

For some things we may need to find new forms of pay-per-view or at-home experiences.

Not everything will be able to reopen at full capacity. And not every solution will be needed or wanted for every problem. But businesses will throw every possible idea against the wall. The ones that stick will be duplicated and improved.

South Korea seems to have done the best job of responding to the Covid crisis and is far ahead of most Western countries in terms of public policy for Covid. Is there a website that is updated daily with news about the South Korean response? Maybe the South Korean health agency has a consumer page with new updates? I am trying to learn about new cases, new approaches to containment, changes to public policies, etc.

Contact tracing and testing can stop the spread. This may not be possible in the US at this stage, but some nations, most notably South Korea and Taiwan have basically stopped the spread through these methods. I should add that masks are used by the entire public in both those countries as well.

So when people bring up the reopening process and talk about social distancing and mask wearing in the coming months does that mean distancing from friends and not going on dates and such? Basically we'd only be going back to work?

Masks for people with one hand?



Hi, does anyone have suggestions or a link on how to sew a mask for someone with one hand? I want to sew a mask for my grandmother, but she can't raise one arm above her shoulder. The masks I'm making tie behind the head, so she won't be able to secure it. The pattern I use for my regular masks is (here)[https://fleetingandfinite.com/blog/2020/4/6/89-filtration-mask-design].

How about instead of tying behind head you use elastic bands that go behind ear? You put it behind one, then behind the other. Should work with one hand.

Are there bots here constantly spamming the message of opening everything?? Everytime I open this thread I am seeing similar comments that try to reason with ending the quarantine. They all follow a common pattern. It's super weird.

An example is u/open-painter . I have seen too many new users like this user that are constantly trying to persuade the mindset towards ending the lockdown. It is super dangerous and something to be aware of.

Testing is flat, positive rate is stable near 1:5. There is no reason we should be returning to widespread "normal" at this point.

Wow, we had slightly good results in Germany, so that they now plan to open the schools again. And what happens? The parks in my city are packed. Not even 6 feet security distance, when buying ice cream. Groups of people on blankets :/. That's the easiest way to destroy every good result, we had.

There's always going to be cases of this, even with a vaccine. The goal wasn't to eliminate the virus, it was to flatten the curve so medical systems don't get overwhelmed. Once that happens, they'll open stuff back up.

If cure refers to vaccine, then this option was never on the table. No country can close down that long. We have to work in the confines of the virus.

Ok, so my mom is from northern wisconsin and visited my sister in idaho right when   hit the fan. She's been quarantined there for over a month but wants to get back home to her dogs... And husband.

We're trying to decide if renting a car and driving (perhaps even sleeping in the car but she's almost 70) or flying would be safer. I keep seeing and hearing how flights barely have any people on them. I don't honestly like the idea of her driving that far herself. My sister has four kids in a pretty small house so I think for everyone's sanity it's time she heads home

So, I've just read some on vaccine production.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164579/

Recent growth of the influenza market has led to investments that have increased current global capacity for seasonal influenza vaccine to around 600M northern hemisphere doses. Northern Hemisphere production capacity is expected to be approx 750–800M doses per year.

First off, they talk about production capacity in PER YEAR numbers. Even if we had production capacity similar to the regular flu shot, which everyone should get every year, when it's mid 2021 and a vaccine finally becomes available if you're not one of those lucky 800 million then just stay indoors and try your luck again in 2022. We're talking how many years after production started will you be able to get your vaccine.

That's enough for like the US, Japan, Germany, France, all other countries? Maybe 2022. Although I wonder where US would even rank on the priority list, with all the pharmaceutical companies working on vaccines in the US, it would probably be US companies mostly making it. However they have a free market, so you will have entire countries bidding against private individuals on an extremely limited supply. A country like Norway comes and bids $10,000 per dose for the initial million doses to vaccinate their elderly and healthcare workers, is Biden or Trump gonna force big pharma to only sell to US customers, will companies ignore the market price and just take the lower profit for the good of the people?

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-effort-to-get-483-million-in-federal-funding-2020-04-16

Maybe there's hope with these new RNA and DNA vaccines that are supposedly easier to mass produce. Although in that article they are still only talking about maybe 1-10 million doses/month in 2021, and it's one of only 4 vaccines currently in phase 1 trials, each person needs 2 doses.

Our vaccine infrastructure is really not ready for this.

Most people do not take the flu shot. In my country almost no one takes it yet our flu mortality rate is not too much different from other countries.

The coronavirus vaccine could, like the flu shot, be preferentially given to vulnerable categories. Elderly, people with severe diseases, obese people (Since that is one of the most dangerous comorbidities for coronavirus) and medical staff, firemen, police.

Question: It’s now clear that as long as there are stay at home orders, there are going to be protests against them that potentially undermine the stay at home orders. You can’t stop people from protesting just by telling them not to, so what’s the plan to deal with protesters among the quarantine until vaccine crowd?

Grocery stores and other essential businesses can just keep implementing and enforcing their social distancing rules/face covering requirements. The protesters really are just spreading it within their own circles if stores don't let them in without the proper precautions.

this is a stupid question. but im going crazy. i havent seen my gf in 5 weeks. i have a summer home an hour away from our houses we could go to. weve both been quarantining since we left. no one feels sick. is it crazy to maybe go spend a weekend together? she has room mates and i live with my family but everyones social distancing and staying in side. but obv i cant go stay for a day or two at her place cause her room mates arent super okay given the situation. trust me when i say im taking this seriously but i gotta know if maybe this isnt such a stupid idea. i miss the   out of her and i really dont wanna go walk around 6 feet apart from her thats like torture. but if thats all i an do i will.

Buy supplies. Buy alcohol. Go together to the summer home. Stay there together for 2+ weeks without going outside. Enjoy yourself. If you go both through full length quarantine, then the chances of others getting sick because of you are slim.

People's mental fortitude is really being put to the test, at least in the US. If only our governors were as blunt as the mayors in Italy when speaking to their people about why it's imperative we stay at home.

As excited as I am for the antibody tests (I'm a laboratory technician who will be performing them), the jury is still out on the diagnostic value of these tests. A "positive" doesn't necessarily mean that you have effective immunity to the disease. For example, I had to get a mumps booster because my titer fell below a certain threshold. A titer means that a positive test is diluted and retested until it is negative. What this means is that a positive test may indicate that you don't have effective immunity. How they determine what that threshold is requires lots of trial and error, and that requires that being exposed even produces immunity. Some vaccines require injection series because single exposures are not enough to produce immune responses to give that lifelong immunity.

A request: please don't speak of "Asia" as one giant country. Asia starts in Turkey and goes all the way to Japan. And, of course, when most people say "Asia," they're actually referring to "East Asia." And "East Asia" itself is a diverse place.

China and Japan are very different countries. China and Taiwan are very different countries. China and Korea are very different countries.

The Japanese are not Chinese people. The Taiwanese are not Chinese people. Koreans are not Chinese people.

Asia is not China.

Tried correcting people on Twitter freaking out saying it has a 5-15% death rate based on confirmed cases only by saying that calculating death rate based on only known cases is wrong, but the death rate is still much worse than the flu and I got lambasted over this.

As many idiots there are who say it’s just the flu there are plenty of others who make this much scarier than it is, and it’s very scary already.

Of course, I would much rather have people be too scared than not at all, but please try to use some critical thinking skills before fear-mongering.

Death rate is about 1-2% for those with symptoms and .5 overall

That was the best educated guess of a leading epidemiologist I head but he was clear that we don’t know for sure

Subgroups have different rates and if hospitals and nursing homes are overrun with cases it can be worse

There seems to be a lot of angry posting against the isolation orders and demands to reopen. There are also a lot of posts pushing back against that and saying we have to stay closed.

Please take the time to read the plan put out by the government. It's a good plan and I recommend you refer people to it.

Solid framework, but it is based on testing and without further federal planning on both PCR and IgG testing, which is lacking. Now, my governor coming out with a similar plan, but it is instead based on hospitalization data, which is better, but still not perfect.

WH plan has implementation problems in the majority of states, but the structure is solid.

Military is usually very, very low on the list of people who need masks. Ours was sent to borders to check for potential coronavirus infected people coming in, with thermometers and all... and no one gave them protective equipment at first.

Stephen King once wrote a horror novel about a deadly plague. In the book, the military all got top of the line respirator masks. I guess Steven King was naive and had too rosy a view of human nature on this point.

Question on symptoms: I've had lung pain over the past week, especially after exertion. I can feel it on the lower right part of my chest, and it radiates to the back. It kinda goes away the next day but it comes back if I exert myself. I've had minor symptoms like chills and fatigue and a little shortness of breath prior to this, but no fever or cough.

Is this something I should get checked out?

It's kind of hard to get medical care if you're not on the verge of dying at the moment, but this is ordinarily something I'd go to a doctor for.

Doesn't sound too urgent to me but I'm not a doctor. I would say stay inside but try to talk to a doctor on the phone and listen to his advice. Don't actually go to the doctor or hospital untill the breathing becomes problematic, but have a plan ready for when it does.

I had something similar. I had a terrible flu for like 3 days but no coughing. A few days later I had lung pain that lasted about a week. It was sort of stabbing pain that would come and go, especially after exertion.

Went to the doctor, I was refused testing.

You might look for anti-body tests around you, at this point you'd have some and that test would confirm them, but wouldn't tell you if you're over it or still in it.

Most urgent cares have chest xrays. That could give you some answers, but unless it's absolutely urgent, I would wait awhile, speak to your PC over the phone or telehealth appt, and see what they say. I had Coronavirus, but only had GI issues and sinus pain. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to get over. Hope everything is ok.

If you don't have a fever, don't risk going to the doctor. Keep an eye on your breathing. Call 911 (emergency services) if it gets bad. If you are brought in by ambulance you are seen right away.

Is it feasible that we will eventually have an over-the-counter, at-home Covid-19 test which doesn't require a long waiting period after infection before producing accurate results, and is accurate on asymptomatic individuals, available to consumers on demand? Kind of like today's pregnancy test. Are there companies working on such tests? What's the anticipated timeframe for widespread market availability?

That's true and certainly worrying, but most all coronaviruses don't have the entire planet working towards a vaccine either. There are no guarantees, but that isn't a good enough reason to say we're  f***ed just yet.

They so often come and go. Take SARS for example. Had that one year of terror, and it hasn’t been seen in its original form since.

But they were close to a vaccine for SARS and if it didn’t totally disappear, they probably would’ve finished it a while ago.

They’re confident here because SARS and Covid are so similar, the hard work they did on SARS is mostly applicable here. Hence some of the wild timeframes

Non-essential. Well, based on what is considered non-essential right now, there may well be alot of asymptomatic Covid travelers flying all over the country. Are we going to ignore that previous positive patients are testing positive yet again? Remember the first week of this? The panic, the shortages, the uncertainty? If we get this wrong, the second wave will be worse.

Starting some time ago, Alaska required all travelers entering the state to self-quarantine for 14 days and to list the address they would be staying at so they could be checked up on. Whether that checking actually happened is unknown. Alaska also limited travel instate and one city (Valdez) even had police at a checkpoint stopping people from entering. Same with many villages in the Bush because of how badly the Spanish Flu epidemic hit them 100 years ago.

I don't think it is a waste at all. You can use one wipe for many items (a doctor has said that. change it when it starts to feel dry). If you don't want to use wipes the other options is keeping those items separate and not using them for a few days. I use hydrogen peroxide to wipe down food products.

Everywhere is short of basic things, PPE especially, and now things like dialysis machines and testing kits are also needed, but no one can help. Just confused why govts arent ordering these things to be made, have companies that are still running but building stuff we dont really need at the moment arent choosing to instead switch to making PPE. It would look good for Nike to stop making shoes and instead make PPE, but it isnt happening. Healthcare workers not having things is just baffling to me. We are all in this together.

It is not as easy. Some countries do not even have the capacities. Most machines and products are patented too and making something new and going through proper testing would take months.

Even when it comes to converting factory for another purpose, it can take weeks or months and the production may not be enough. Right now most of the World is pretty much depending on China's production, as everyone moved the production there in efforts to save costs.

The production taking a long time to catch up is one of the reasons why it is so essential to slow down the spread right now. I am glad that my country implemented strict measures ASAP and sent all the planes available to China to bring back medical materials as soon as mid March, when there was still something to buy.

As of right now, countries refusing to go through China and countries that took their sweet time will be cardinally screwed for a while.

They compiled an estimate of the people who died of Covid without getting tested, and did a data dump, worldmeter recorded them into the day of reporting rather than the days of deaths. Database websites do this regularly as various countries catch up on their estimates.

A large metropolitan area and a big travel destination, so there could have been much faster spread in the beginning. Also people returned from spring break from Florida in big amounts (Similar as what happened in the Alps during European spring break).

Then there are international institutions like UN, so many people that pretty much travel all over the World all the time, as well as the stock exchange... yet more traveling.

Together with that, many rich businessmen live in rich parts of New York and they are also among the groups of people that travel a lot.

The concentration of people is large, taxis and public transportation is perfect ground for rapid spread and packed offices are as well.

It will be combination of some of these reasons together with many more, making NY more susceptible. And the countermeasures, unlike in many other places, were properly put into effect only after it was already everywhere in NY.

It happened across multiple countries. UK, France, China, USA. A sudden jump when they decided to add people dying at their home and in nursing home to the statistics.

This is one of the reasons why the statistics from various countries cannot be directly compared. Every country has its own guidelines on how to count the numbers, who to test etc. Some countries include in the statistics everyone dying of pneumonia, even without testing them, while some countries completely ignore anything that happened outside of hospital.

I do not know the exact numbers, but I am afraid they are right. It is not supposed to be that way, but because of the extreme shortage of protective equipment, CDC changed its guidelines, just to take away medical staff's option to sue the hospitals, forcing them to work even with insufficient protection.

Edit: Answered / "Solved": Its called "Viral Load".

I wonder if there is more evidence elsewhere about this following theory on the amount of COVID-19 viruses inhaled.

In an article linked below a German doctor suggests that...

Inhaling the virus in larger amount leads to more critical effects on the lung, explaining several younger healthy doctors and caretakers in their 30s showing severe symptoms or even dying recently.

Such a correlation sounds intuitive, i.e. that the severity of the respiratory symptoms are proportional to the amount of inhaled viruses still...

Q: I'm curious if there's other articles or studies stating this correlation?

Sorry, the linked article is in German. These days your browser will manage to translate it I bet:

For the most part yes, however they've eased restrictions and have opened up children's clothing stores and book shops.

That being said they still have about 500 people dying a day and over 3000 new cases daily. They're still no where close to being fully open.

Luckily for Italy, their people seem to be more patient and value real human life over a made up social construct.

Never been to NYC but is the subway system the only form of transportation in the city? Wouldn't taxis/ubers get you to your destination in a fairly quickly since a lot of none essential stuff is shut down and creating less traffic? Point is I feel like the subway system is a hot zone for catching the virus. It's cool that masks are now mandatory but those things are not meant to fully protect you.

OP doesn't realize people that are taking the subway are essential workers, which don't get paid much to begin with and in most cases aren't getting additional hazard pay now. Your average Uber ride costs $10-15, twice a day that's $20-30.

8 hour shift X $15/hr = $120 X 80% = $96 take home pay.

20/96 = 20% 30/96 = 31%

So they basically are wondering why essential workers aren't spending 20-30% of their wages on transportation.

Personally, I'd rather take public transit than an Uber during COVID-19. If the uber driver is infected, there is a REALLY HIGH chance that I get the virus as well - close contact in a non-ventilated space for a prolonged period of time. However if I encounter one infected person in the subway, it's a super brief encounter, there's much more ventilation, I have a much lower chance of catching the disease. I do have to be more vigilant about not touching shared surfaces, washing my hands immediately after, and maintaining distance as best I can, but i dunno, it just feels less dangerous.

The flip side of that is if I only see one person (my uber driver), then I have a much lower chance of encountering an infected person than if I pass by 50 different people on the subway.

How cautious should I be of the goods I purchase from the supermarket?

A friend of mine (without any sources) claimed you need to wipe them down with disinfectant wipes.

I’ve read numerous articles claiming and countering other stories about how to clean goods purchased from the supermarket.

Are goods I buy low risk? If not, what’s the best course of action to eliminate risk?

you could use alcohol or disinfectant wipes on the surfaces of products, because transmission can still occur if, for example, you were to touch the virus and then touch your face. however, it’s believed that you can’t catch it from consuming it, so if you touch vegetables that will later get cooked or not it should be okay. at least that’s what most research has shown so far. just wash your hands after touching items you’ve bought and wipe down what you can. the virus can live for days outside the body.

I have a serious question— how is civilization not going to collapse? The economy is already  f***ed after a month. Even if things are reopened they’ll just be closed again. Either we live life for 2 years without 80% of the workforce or we learn to live with 5% of the population dying. Neither of those are sustainable. Protests will turn into riots and the same idiot we have controlling everything has the nuclear football and a scapegoat.

WW2 drastically changed the economic and political landscape of the world. There’s a chance we could be seeing that model of civilization collapse now. Of course the story won’t end, but a new chapter could begin. One that doesn’t look very similar to what we had before.

If the US doesn’t get its   together it’s not going to be great, but it won’t be the end of the US. Though maybe the decline will accelerate from here on. Ever since Trump came to office other countries have been learning how to do without US power and support. So that will just continue.

We put a man on the moon to answer this exact question. JFK issued an impossible challenge with an unrealistic deadline 50 years before experts of the day predicted we'd have the technology to do it. Why? Because he had faith in mankind to figure it out.

This could all go sideways tomorrow, but I'm going to bet it doesn't because I know what humanity is capable of.

It might. A lot of rich and powerful people are betting it won’t. They’ll be fighting like hell to try to prevent it. I am skeptical of things recovering rapidly as soon as we re-open. For better or worse, people are terrified of this virus. So they won’t rush out and fill up restaurants, resorts, hotels, stadiums, malls, and airplanes. A lot of people are going to be timid. 40% of Americans are obese, for example. They’ll still be afraid of getting sick and possibly dying. Or spreading it to loved ones. Likewise businesses may not rapidly rehire the 22m who got laid off.

I think the biggest risk is this sort of stall. If our political leaders say “ok everyone, let’s open back up,” but people don’t react, then I think once Wall Street sees that happening, then I think you’ll see the true economic crash way bigger than we saw in March. You’ll see a true panic that the damage done was permanent, and that kind of crash could lead to a bigger collapse of societal structures.

However, I’m actually encouraged by seeing people flock to beaches as soon as they’re reopening. It’s actually a sign that people will get the money moving again once we reopen, which should hopefully prevent an economic apocalypse that could lead to Western Civilization collapsing.

It’ll be interesting to see how things play out. The specter of the virus remains a looming threat. We’re dependent on our scientific community to bail us out.

It probably means it has spread through a fairly decent chunk of the world population, however.

Now the question is, just how many of us have had it? We know its higher than the ~2.3 Million cases world wide, but just how many really have had it.

Is it the 10x number that I've seen floating around and 23 million people have had it, or are we looking at more of that 70x number that has been suggested in Scotland, Denmark, and Santa Clara, and we are looking at 161 Million cases? Or hell, has 10% of the world had it and we are looking at an absolutely staggering 700 million (I can't imagine its that high)

I know I shouldn’t say this for many reasons, but I want everything to go on and open up full blast. Think about it, those who have office jobs will continue to stay home, blue collared jobs were never home, kids will stay home since its just about summer, the people who are out were always out and about, and only the service class will really be affected but will at least get paid. The people who want to stay home will, but the others can go out (like FL) and do as they please.

I know as much as we want to go back to our original lives and get back to work. But the virus is still around and there is no vaccine. They want to open the economy back up but is that not bad? First, they said don't buy masks cause it won't help you. Then now, they making it a requirement for everyone to wear a mask! WTF? Now, they want to open the economy back up and open the beaches up when we don't even have n95 masks! I've been struggling to find toilet paper and even get my hands on a n95 masks and they want to reopen the economy! I know we need to get back to work but how can we when we don't even have enough tests and each state is left to defend for itself. I am perplexed about this!

It's sad, but I think states have realized that they are nearing the point where they have to open up not just for economic reasons, but because eventually, you lose compliance and all goes to   immediately and this virus becomes the least of your problems

You won't be able to do it just yet. Any effect, be it loosening of restrictions, people going out or new counter measures can only be observed and evaluated properly 2-3 weeks afterwards, since the virus takes some time to go through incubation period and then a few more days for people with symptoms to get bad enough to go to hospitals or to get tested.

And with current backlog of tests, it might take another week before the people get results back.

I honestly don’t think it will make any difference overall. The best case would be seeing multiple members from a small community protesting and creating a hotspot in their area.

Large congregations were happening among religious individuals in New York and we didn’t see noticeable differences. Although New York has a massive population so that may have been hard to measure.

Most of the artists don't have any recording equipment. Vanessa Hudson was singing into some earbuds. In the pre-show, some were playing audio out of their laptop and singing along rather than having actual software mixing it.

Maybe my expectations were off. I don't know why I thought that singers would know how to set themselves up and have a decent mic in their own home.

Others have said that this is helpful so I'm re-posting this here. I’m a chemo nurse, this is what I tell my high-risk patients:

Food is pretty low-risk, but I personally don’t trust takeout that much because I think a lot of restaurant workers don’t have sick leave, so it’s more likely that your food was prepared by someone symptomatic. But you can cut the risk to near zero by doing this:

Wash your hands well

Put your own container on your kitchen counter

Pick up the restaurant container, and pour the food into your own container

Throw away the restaurant container

Wash your hands well

Thoroughly heat up the food. ( 70C/158F for 5 minutes, or whatever the best current guideline says)

If you do this, in this order, you are extremely safe even if someone coughed viruses all over the food and the container. Heat would kill the virus, and handwashing would prevent indirect transmission from the bag/container. Take care!

Hi everyone, I have a quick question.

I've been in my apartment for the past 5 weeks. I've only left my room to do laundry, get mail, or throw out trash outside. I always wash my hands and wipe down everything when I come back.

I'm considering going back home, which is about 2 hours away. The only problem is I don't want to get my parents sick. If I go back home, I can't self-isolate because I don't have a desk in my room to do work and I don't have a shower connected to my room, so I will have to walk through the house.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? Should I continue staying in my apartment? Is it safe to go home? I'm the only one who lives here, so it has been pretty lonely.

You have a low probability of getting your parents sick. However, your parents could potentially get you sick as well if they haven't been following proper SIP protocol.

I am not saying dont go home though. If you do decide to go home be prepared to spend 2 to 3 months there sheltering in place.

In my opinion you shouldn't be going home for just a week or so. You should only be relocating if you will be staying for an extended amount of time.

If you live in a hotspot, just stay home. If not, you're probably fine, but if everyone did things that were "probably fine," this mess will go on a lot longer than it should.

Your feelings are valid. And we have to suffer together or else we'll all go out together. I hate this too. I hate it every single day, so does my husband, and my two year old is absolutely miserable. And when I think of my child dying because I was impatient, or anyone else I love, I swallow it and muddle through.

Isolation is miserable. Quarantine is miserable. The news is miserable. The outlook is currently dismal. I do not begrudge you your misery. Grief and despair are to be expected during this time. Hang in there.

well, there are states that will be re-opening in May. My suggestion is that you pack up & relocate. I have a couple friends in the hotel/restaurant business out here in SoCal who've started to brainstorm alternative life trajectories if this lockdown goes through the summer for their industry. And one of their options is relocating to regions with less restrictions on eateries/bars/resorts.

Dude, it's been just over a month. I don't want to be insensitive, but you gotta toughen up. We all have to do our part to help each other, and things will slowly start to improve. You can still get outside to take walks, go for bike rides, etc.

If you are feeling suicidal, call someone. A friend, a family member, or even a hotline.

So I get all the China hate on here, but imagine how bad this would have been if China had not locked Wuhan province and instead done what most of the rest of the world has done.

Imagine New York City completely shutting down for 3 months just one week after its first death and the entire state shutting down a few days later. And not the, you can still go jogging and shopping, kind of shutdown. A real shutdown where you can’t leave your house at all. And the rest of us are whining and dreaming up conspiracy theories after a month. Boo hoo.

It could have been worse. It could have started in America.

Yeah... like what happened in Austria and Italy. They did not want to lose on tourist money, so towns in Alps downplayed the epidemic, causing the happily skiing people on their spring breaks to spread the disease all over Europe.

say what you will about China's stats- but they contained the virus to one part of China better than we did here in America. Didn't spread across their whole country to the extent it did here.

I live in a duplex, 9 of us total. We do infrequent, consolidated shops. Even being quick and efficient there's no way you can shop for 9 people in 30 minutes for a week's worth of food. This would force more of us to go more frequently. Try to remember not everyone is in the same situation you are in.

The Trump administration awarded an N95 mask procurement contract worth eight times the usual price to a bankrupt company with no employees which has never even manufactured the respirator masks, according to a new report.

The company, Panthera, claims to provide tactical training and "mission support" for the Department of Defense and other government agencies. However, it has no experience with manufacturing or medical equipment, The Washington Post reported this week. Panthera's parent company filed for bankruptcy in the fall, and it has not employed anyone since May 2018.

According to the contract terms, FEMA will pay Panthera $55 million for 10 million N95 respirator masks, or $5.50 a mask. 3M, one of the nation's largest manufacturers, charges the government between $0.63 and $1.50 per N95 mask, depending on the model. Prestige Ameritech, the largest U.S. mask manufacturer, charged FEMA about $0.80 cents per mask in an order of 12 million.

FEMA clarified that Panthera is a distributor — not a manufacturer. A Panthera executive told The Post he had made the arrangements through his military contacts and claimed he would deliver on the contract before May 1 "for certain" and "with a very high-quality product."

I fear the new normal will be expensive.

Seats at theatres spread out. Less people mean more expensive tickets.

Restaurant capacities drop, need to charge more if there's less customers.

I don't even know how concerts will work.

Guess I'm never flying again.

This is going to be tough.

For the millionth time. The point of all this was to make sure the medical system didn’t collapse. It didn’t. We aren’t planning to lockdown until a vaccine comes. We have to be able to function somewhat and that includes going places and doing things. People can be responsible and make this work.

Dog owners are you still walking your dog(s)? I have occasionally late at night but I just realized when I got back. For all I know there’s some infected house in my neighborhood who also has a dog and some family members might have walked their dog right where I was just walking. with mine. I’m sure the people in that hypothetical house were petting the dog and maybe getting the virus on their fur and that dog was sniffing the same bushes and   that my dog was just stuffing her face in. And someone might kiss my dog tomorrow and then boom we’re  f***ed. Nothing feels safe man. Is this insane?

Serious question, why is no one talking about the White House's guidelines for "opening up america".

They just announced it yesterday, and it seems like a pretty decent approach (credit where it's due).

Yet, this sub, and most other subs, are packed with articles about how "The federal government wants to lift all restrictions" And "We're opening up too fast!"

I am curious why this seemingly massive news is completely swept under the rug. It seems like a pretty decent and conservative approach to opening up.. I personally think it's a good idea. Is there any glaringly wrong things with it i'm not aware of?

Mixed signals. Especially from Trump. If he just stuck to the script on the website, would be fine. Also the federal government still isn't really giving the states the support and coordination that is needed to carry out the plan.

It seems rather optimistic to me (I think theaters should be phase 3 or later, for example) but I think the main everyone is ignoring it is that we all know the states are going to ignore it and issue their own guidelines, and then a lot of people are going to ignore a lot of their own state recommdations too. The actual outcome will have almost nothing to do with federal recommendations.

I think it is not too bad, although some observation periods could be longer. Most changes take at least 14 days to show effect, so giving it 3 wees of observation instead of 2 might be safer.

The one glaring thing is that opening up of economy should be paired up with mandatory mask wearing. It is the easiest and most efficient way to slow down spread and to prevent any huge spikes in cases from appearing.

It is better to mandate protective equipment and social distance at work rather than not letting people go to work at all. And by now the data should clearly show that countries with mandatory mask wearing did flatten the curve extremely quickly, while even maintaining large part of economy open.

Once the curve is flattened we need people to spread the disease. Too many people in this sub want lockdown until a vaccine is created

Any sources on America having the highest death rate? Seems Based off real data Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Sweden all have a higher death per 1 million rate. Do you foresee a wild explosion occurring to get us into the millions in deaths. And you think an explosion would occur and the government wouldnt do a full lockdown, instead letting the death toll climb to 10 million? Are you aware parts of the EU are re opening already or soon?

It's too early to say that. There is a path through this if people continue to get the numbers down with social distancing while test capability is being ramped up. If the levels get low enough then they put together a plan on how to open and track and contain any outbreaks that crop up.

I don't know if anyone can help me : I've been having a debate for days with someone who swears that Fauci told Trump back in January that the threat of Covid was low, that Fauci gave Trump and the task force bad info, and basically that this whole debacle is Fauci's fault.

He also refuses to acknowledge any article written by "the biased liberal media."

Can anyone direct me to releases that show what Fauci's recommendations in December, January, and February were that isn't a "liberal media" source?

This person isn't searching for answers. He's moving the goalposts and deliberately changing conditions so he can continue ignoring reality and maintain his allegiance to the cult.

Even if such an unlikely source was to be found, he'd immediately invent a new criteria by which to ignore it.

Why would Trump solely have Fauci as his source of information

Fauci is not in US intelligence and is not in his cabinet

Further what Fauci was saying publicly about what Americans should worry about and what he thought the CDC (he is NIC) should have been preparing for as a contingency plan are not the same

There was no “task force” to my knowledge until March

This fellow is in Trumps cabinet and was sounding alarms that Trump was ignoring

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar

He has been totally marginalized in the Trump reality show. Now it’s the blame game: Fauci, WHO, Obama, Pelosi

So I stumbled upon an old journal article that showed how effective the supplement/medication NAC(n-acetylcysteine) was in protecting the lungs from damage while infected with variations of the flu, in turn also shortening sick time. (Nih article here).

I obviously have no idea how the damage coronavirus causes compares to the damage the flu causes to the lungs, but I figured maybe NAC would be helpful for those with coronavirus as well or maybe even taking it as a precaution could set yourself up for success preemptively in case you get sick.

I'm no doctor or scientist, by any means, but what do you guys think?

Any doctors or science degrees in here who might give insight into why I might be crazy/might be on to something?

This a USA question. Any idea if there will be a 2nd stimulus package that would send money directly to us like the $1,200? I am unemployed and got the $1,200 this week. I filed unemployment in FL and I'm not confident in Florida's ability to handle the situation and I wont be surprised if I end up needing to appeal a denial. So I feel like I can't rely on unemployment.

Would be great if they just decided to send another $1,200 to Americans next month. The uncertainty is super frustrating. Unemployment is a disaster.

I am not from the USA, but I keep watching all sorts of international news and so far it seems like the US government wants to avoid the need for more stimulus packages as much as possible, trying to open up economy, just so they wouldn't have to pay more.

This will already make US debt skyrocket. Some estimates said there could be 18% of GDP increase in national debt this year alone. On the other hand, elections are coming up, so handing out money to people might have greater support.

I wish US was more left leaning and implemented the solution common in parts of Europe, where if employers promise not to fire anyone, the government pays 60%-80% of the salaries and the employer pays the rest.

Hearing many reports of people saying corona virus has been named in the death certificate even though either they tested negative or they weren't tested at all, why? Also why is Britain not counting care home death's? If as some people think they are trying to inflate the number of covid deaths, why are they leaving out care homes which will potentially be the worst sector effected? When will the UK start testing people? Testing is the key to ending lock down but I can't see any progress where that is concerned. Many people seem to think vaccines are the only answer to end this (I'm not anti vax at all but I just feel this all seems fishy) if they make a vaccine will it be mandatory or like the flu jab where u can decline it? We reckon Mt partner may have had covid 19 and I never got sick if I got it which is quite likely, why do I need a vaccine? I'm finding this all very confusing tbh

Bilateral interstitial pneumonia is relatively uncommon. When it shows up on the CT scan with ground glass opacities and other symptoms with radical increase in frequency during an epidemic, absent available lab testing or contrary evidence the doctor may reasonably presume it is the epidemic endemic disease. The government refusing to permit adequate testing for political reasons should not be able to prevent medical diagnosis.

What would be the difference of you having the disease, have had the disease, and never had the disease? The restrictions are all the same, unless it would make you feel comfort that you may be good to go as far as immunity (still unknown how long and any long term effects). I would recommend that the virus doesn’t control you, follow the guidelines, and manage your risk.

the government didn't want hoarders to buy up N95 like they did toilet paper. Because the front line infantry would of died and no is qualified to run a hospital other than medical staff.

Masks sold out> Hospitals workers infected> No workers to help the sick> lots of dead people

That's why after the stay-at-home order, removal of students, and non essential worker .... infections were still rising because it's a respiratory transmitting virus.....to mitaged further after the initial panic, multiple state's counties' said bandanas, gaiters, cloth face mask are mandatory for 100% people outside their homes, to be enforced by police to prevent the airborne and droplet transmission.... soon afterwards the federal government did the same: CDC, and Trump said wear a cloth mask in public.

Most hospital grade N95 masks are like this

A cloth mask is better than no mask. Don't buy N95 unless you immunocompromised, or elderly Due to hospital shortages and the need for N95 masks specifically.

If you get Coronavirus, Scientists say its the ‘viral dose’ you initially inhale that determines your viral load and if you're going to die or not. Remember young healthy 20 year olds are dying. If you want to have the assurance of a N95 (95% filtration) instead of a cotton assurance (70% filtration) wear a home made/ Etsy bought polypropylene/HEPA/cotton or air-conditioning/cotton 3 triple layer facemask (99% filtration) and to minimize the initial dose. Even if you wear a cotton single layer (70% effective) you'll only get mild symptoms, instead of deadly...by limiting the initial dose and anything is better than nothing due to the fact that even if you're young and healthy a large exposure will kill you.

https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/14/how-much-of-the-coronavirus-does-it-take-to-make-you-sick/

I recommend buying/making triple layer nonwoven polypropylene with inner cotton fabric masks, they sell some on Etsy. It's the same concept as the
N95, since it sandwiches polypropylene between it's outer shell.

If you're extreme you can buy or make those mask with pockets and insert cutout of HEPA vaccum filter material or air-conditioning filter material inside the mask slot, they're equal in effectivity as N95.

I was really surprised by how anti-mask US and UK seemed to be. In my country they ordered mandatory wearing of masks right in the beginning and told people to make their own textile masks.

It even went so far in the US that they started to claim that wearing masks is detrimental and can increase rate of infection. And now people are pushing back, saying that wearing masks somehow impedes their freedoms.

Masks do not really protect the wearer much, but do protect others from the wearer. Why are people so against such a simple and efficient thing?

It's just my personal theory, but I think many people in here in the US have an arrogant mindset. They see pictures of people in Asia wearing masks, even before this virus, and think "We are better than them. Their country is so terrible they have to wear masks. We are great, so we don't."

So, make it mandatory and whip anyone with arrogant mindset with a hefty fine.

In most cases, it would be fine, but wearing masks is not about protecting yourself, but protecting others. Letting people who are selfish and arrogant endanger others should not be tolerated.

One's freedom stops where the freedom of another starts.

I think the reality of her is that she has to work with the Trump administration and they’ve come to the conclusion that this thing is just going to go through the United States some people are gonna be affected mildly and some people are just not going to make it. They tried to bend the curve in 1918 and it worked until the second wave. The more that I look at this whole situation I believe that what they did was just basically to lock down to buy themselves enough time to be able to build up a supply of ventilators gowns gloves and equipment. Now that they have that happening they’re ready to re-open up and basically you make it you make it you don’t you don’t expect to see the death numbers definitely go up. And then of course the controlled media is going to start to focus on the election and other things and what’s going to happen with coronavirus it’s going to become this five minute update every day. If I remember in the beginning of this they were talking about therapeutics already being developed by now if you notice no one’s talking about the therapeutics anymore. My daughter works for a major Fortune 100 company they already told all their employees don’t expect to be back fully in the office until well into 2021.

Imagine having to speak to public during serious health crisis in a nation where people during crisis are able to loot and riot, or take up arms against oppressive government. Or at least panic and do runs on shops, or buy untested medicines and take them without consultations with their doctors.

That must be one hell of a stressful job.

We would love to have more data. But not enough testing, especially for those with no symptoms or mild symptoms and in lower risk groups. Which are often younger people.

I’ve been in this sub for 6 weeks and haven’t seen any say it doesn’t care about age. What they have said is that being young doesn’t mean you can’t get hospitalized or can’t die from an infection.

Bravo!
Some USA COVID-19 numbers current as of Friday April 17th ( sourced from JHU and NYT) .

Total number of tests administered: 3.6 M (1.1% of population.)

Current testing rate 146,000 daily, or 44 per 100,000 people.

(CDC says we should only think about reopening anything when daily testing is at 500 -700K daily for a month. That's at minimum a tripling of the daily testing rate. Another way to break it down is that we should be at a minimum of 152 tests per 100,000 people, the average is 44 per 100k per state, and the only state to meet the 152 criteria is Rhode Island.

Out of the 3.6 million tests there are 732,000 cases, for a 20% positive rate. While epidemiologists seem confident the percentage will go down as the number of tests go up, the WHO advises that no social distancing should be relaxed until the positive test percentage is 10% or lower.

Out of those 732,000 cases, 630,000 are still active and 102,000 resolved. 64,000 folks have recovered and 38,000 have died. In other words, at the moment, with only 15% of the cases resolved, if you test positive you have a 37% chance of dying.

Based on what has been going on around the world, the virus can incubate for up to 14 days. If it is severe enough to cause death, that process can take up to 10 weeks. The longest course of COVID-19, then, would be 12 weeks.

Ballpark figures going forward: Let's say we make the CDC goal of 500,000 tests daily. That means that we will have tested a total of 15M people from yesterday to May 17th, for a total of 18.6 M, or 5.7 % of the population.

Let's say the CDC is right, and the positive rate drops to 10% from the current 20%. That would be 1.5 M positive tests, plus the current 732,000, for a total of 2.23 M. Subtracting the 102K cases already resolved, that's just over 2.1 M cases.

Thinking positively, and imagining that the fatality rate drops from 37% to 25%, that would leave us with just over 540,000 deaths, including the current 38,000.

As cases that end in fatalities can take up to 3 months to resolve (usually no less than 2), we will not have fatality numbers for the cases tested this month. However, if the current 600,000 outstanding cases have even a 25% fatality rate, by May 17 we should have about 190K dead.

Even imagining there are magically no cases after May 17, by mid-August those 1.5 M positives could turn into 375,000 more deaths, for a total of just over 565K dead.Remember that this is with the current state of stay at home orders (and the issues with noncompliance of same) in place and based on testing of just over 5% of the population.

This has to be a troll.



Using the closed cases in the middle of a pandemic is just not the right way to calculate fatality rate. It is nowhere near 25%. Estimates range from 0.5% to 4%. Probably around 1.4%

The average incubation period is 5 days. The average time from symptom onset to death is 17 days. That means 22 days is the average time from contraction of virus to death. Nowhere near the 2 to 3 months that you cite. The average time from symptom onset to hospital discharge is 24 days. So it takes a week longer for someone to recover than to die. That's why the closed cases are skewed heavily towards death.

Testing more people does not cause more people to die. We are capturing nearly every death right now. Testing positive for Covid-19 is no longer required to be classified as a Covid-19 death. That means that testing more people like you say will only drive that fatality rate down rapidly

The infection fatality rate is not 37%. The case fatality rate always appears higher than the IFR, significantly so because it often takes longer for people to recover than to die and because we don't have 100% knowledge of the number of infected persons. All we have is an estimate based on how many have been tested. Some of those estimates put the total number of infected at 60x the number of confirmed infected. The IFR is likely somewhere around .5% +- .3%, nowhere near 25% or 37%. That's still high; it's potentially 8x higher than the flu, for example, but chill out and stop freaking out unnecessarily. A third of people who get the virus are not going to die.

If/when a general vaccine is rolled out, I don't know if I'll be taking it or giving it to my kids immediately. I'm not anti-vax, my whole family is vaccinated. But I'm not confident in a new drug, developed in a hurry, that has had various testing and certifications bypassed so we could rush it to market. There have been vaccines in the past that have caused real complications. My family doesn't have any major risk factors (that we know of). I dunno, I'll have to do a lot more research between now and then.

What are other people's plans? Are you going to be first in line? Going to wait?

Yes, it's scaring the hell out of me that even Dr Fauci is giving extremely optimistic timelines and everyone is running around with 12-18 months as their baseline. Even some well-educated level-headed friends of mine all think that a year for a vaccine, soup to nuts, is somehow both realistic and safe.

People have their minds blown when they learn that comparable vaccines take 5, 10, 15+ years, and are still not ready and not safe. The amount of prior knowledge was so minimal and the fresh expectations just set are so unrealistic, people are flabbergasted to learn that an average time in development for all the vaccines out there is 15-20 years

We can roll out a vaccine within a year to a year and a half, but that would be testing in production. We'd be learning about side effects for years to come. Sure, a pandemic as serious as this, we have no safe choices and we have to cut corners. But the reason vaccines take so long is precisely because it takes a hell of a long time to figure out what goes right and what goes wrong. Vaccine development is not like building a website or rolling out an app. It's nine women giving birth in one month type of situation.

People globally are becoming restless and I think as we head into the 6th week of the lockdowns, people will rebel against any further extensions

We will have riots on our hands otherwise as people are struggling to live and may well die of hunger if forced to continue to sit at home

I supported the lockdowns when they were described as a measure to allow hospitals time to stock up and prepare.

I would support a time table of re-opening slowly to also help the hospitals withstand the wave of patients

I do not support this moronic idea that we can some how stop the virus with shutting everything down.

It's a pathetic attempt to control something that cannot be controlled.

Instead of an actual plan it feels like it's turned into a political game of chicken.

Who ever tried to save their state's economy will be called a murderer as if it's their fault there is a disease that kills the old and sick.

But there will never be a good time to reopen the economy. We could be down to zero deaths and only 1 new case a week. The moment we open up in anyway it will spread like crazy again. There will be surges

What then, shut it all down again and pretend like we can just never leave the house again while the gov just sends us money

"It's ok the rich will pay for it"

You don't want Americans protesting give them a specific set of circumstances when they can get back to providing for their families.

My wife is a covid nurse and we have a 3-year-old and a 9-year-old. I leave the garage open, she comes home, takes off work clothes in the garage, sprays shoes with Lysol, goes right to the shower. I put on gloves and take the clothes to the basement putting them right into the laundry machine. So far we are all healthy.

Also basically anyone who is scared of covid at her hospital or has a baby / is pregnant pretty much doesn’t have to come in and still gets paid. So far there’s no financial benefit to caring for covid patients, nurses who are home are still getting paid and assumably nurses with newborns will not be working at this time, at least at my wife’s hospital.

A great article on second waves in other countries. It just lets you know that we will be bouncing back and forth between the phases released by the trump Admin in the US and why testing not only in our country but for those entering is so important.

I thought the problem with antibody test was sensitivity, let's say you have a test that is 95% accurate, if you test a thousand people and only ten percent of them actually have antibodies, then about one third of your people who tested positive on your antibody test would be "false positives", that is, they don't have the antibody but the test says that they do, so they walk away from the test thinking they had immunity. This is a big problem with any test where the condition you are looking for is very rare in a large population.

Had talked about this before that with coronavirus it’s not even just about respiratory it’s also about your heart very sad to see that this Broadway performer is going to have to have his leg amputated because of the virus. There is so much that we don’t know about this virus and how it really affects all the organs of the body besides the lungs.

I wish people would stop bringing these articles here without context to incite fear. A LOT of things can cause blood clots, and some people of all ages are more prone to them than others. Please keep in mind this is not a doctor who wrote this article, it's just based on tweets and anecdotes from this guy's wife. We don't know anything about his pathology.

No one is here to incite fear. Knowledge is power and knowing that this virus has more areas of impact than just respiratory is important. If you recall in the beginning when we learned about this virus everybody was saying check for fever, check for shortness of breath etc..when in fact there are other symptoms you can have .. it could be all of those symptoms or one of them ..we didn’t even know till recently that 80% of people who go on ventilators don’t come off of them and survive. Is that to incite fear or to make you take action early enough with symptoms so to reduce your chances of ending up in a worse case scenario?

We have known the ventilator thing for a long time. The initial rates coming out of italy were even worse than 20% I think. Ventilator mortality rates (over a certain age) are grim even for non- COVID diseases, and physicians don't even like to put very elderly patients on them period because they are so unlikely to survive it.

True..that’s why it’s important to have the facts. This isn’t a board to create fear...the more you know the better an informed decision you can make for yourself.. I have a Doctor friend who makes a very good point “what do you call someone who graduates at the top of their medical school and gets licensed..”DOCTOR” ..what do you call someone who graduates at the bottom of their medical school and gets licensed..“ DOCTOR” ..his point being.. there are qualified and unqualified people in every profession. My daughter when she was five years old had a medical condition ..we went through five doctors in our pediatric doctors office each one gave a different diagnosis I finally ran her down to the children’s hospital where the emergency room physician told me to give her medicine and take her back home ..I told him to give me his medical license number because I would sue him if she died ..turns out had I taken her back home 48 hours later she would’ve died..It was the specialist at the Children’s Hospital who knew immediately upon seeing her what she had. Better for you to walk in like you know what you are talking about than listen to someone who thinks they know what they are talking about just because they wear a white coat. Plenty of stories in the headlines of people that had Covid and got sent home to die.

" Doing so involves placing a sterile swab at the back of a patient’s nasal passage, where it connects to the throat via the nasopharynx, for several seconds to absorb secretions. Scott Wesley Long, a clinical microbiologist who directs Houston Methodist Hospital’s diagnostic microbiology lab, says the swab is thin—less than three millimeters in diameter at its tip. “Once you place it in the back of the throat, it’s uncomfortable, but you can still breathe and talk,” he says. “It’s not as bad as it looks.” After a sample is collected, the swab goes into a liquid-filled tube for transport "

Had a long discussion yesterday with a friend of mine who thinks the lockdowns should all be lifted and is inclined to think that the whole thing is some kind of conspiracy. I don't agree with his conclusions obviously but I found myself kind of understanding how he got there.

He talked about how he's not a scientist or a doctor. That leaves him depending on what leaders and experts are saying. The problem is what they're saying is all over the place. The CDC said that masks are ineffective and no one needed them unless they were sick. Then they changed this and now say that everyone should wear a mask. Trump also says that everyone should be wearing a mask but then he follows this by saying that he won't wear a mask himself. We've been told that we're not going to catch the virus if we're 6 ft away from someone. We've been told that 6 ft is more than close enough to catch the virus if you're there for 10 mins or longer. We've been told that even 6 ft is risky for any amount of time. We've been told that anti-body tests are what's needed to re-open things. Now the WHO says that anti-body tests are ineffective. Trump says we've reached the peak. The governor of my state says we won't reach the peak here for another two weeks. My state has banned drive in movie theaters from opening saying that people in cars with their windows up is too risky no matter how far apart those cars are. It also allows drive in church services as long as cars are parked with an empty spot between them. Meanwhile we both know people who were very sick, went to the doctor and were told that they probably had it but they're not going to test and they should just go home and rest. You go in for the flu and they test you to confirm the diagnosis. To not do so would be irresponsible. For something that's supposed to be a pandemic, there's no testing and that's from the experts. If the experts keep feeding us bull  that they later contradict, why should we believe anything at all that they say?

I have to admit that the guy kind of makes sense. Personally, I'm staying home, ordering anything I need and quarantining my packages. I can 100% understand where he's coming from though and I have no idea how to change his mind because what he says does make some kind of sense.

I would say as far as pandemics go it’s better to overreact than to under react. We can all be pissed off for awhile because we had tight restrictions but most will probably forget about it a couple months from now.

As far as lives/livelihood lost because of financial reasons that will be the one that lingers over us for a long time.

That's part of his argument though. Do we really have a pandemic? We don't even know how many people are sick because they're not testing people. They just send them home telling them they have it and then add them to the number.

I get that but we take the best possible data we have and make a decision based upon it. Could this be just like the flu as far as death rate? Yes. Could this be just be like SARS as far as death rate? Yes. Which way do we want to take that gamble?

We take that gamble every year with the flu though and we gamble that it's not another Spanish flu and it seems to work out fine. He seemed to be of the opinion that a lot of what we're hearing is just media fearmongering. And then he pointed out the media fearmongers a lot. He's not wrong either.

It's the opposite in many states. In New York, where I'm at, you aren't counted unless you have a confirmed test. I know multiple team who suffered COVID-like symptoms in March but weren't in bad enough shape to get tested, and thus never counted.

Less exposure to other people to slow the spread down until we have enough information and resources to deal with it. As we find out more information on how it spreads there will naturally be further adjustments to how we need to react to protect ourselves.

It gets dicey when you have people with conflicting interests putting in their 2 cents when they are not qualified to make claims. Trump is a prime example of this. He’s more willing to take the economic considerations into effect even though he doesn’t have a clue how the disease functions. Of course he is more willing to push for these factors as the economy and more specifically stock market are where he values his presidency. Loss of human life is acceptable to him as long as the Dow Jones is looking good.

Doctors and medical researchers are far more likely to push for the more conservative approach in getting the least impact to individuals and society as a whole medically. They’re far more willing to value the lives of individuals over rich people’s (and that’s really what we’re talking about) money.

That’s not to say the scientists and medical experts are giving projections that will allow the economy to burn indefinitely. These people are constantly taking into account socioeconomic impact for their projections, they just lean toward saving human lives. Their projections and recommendations change based on these impacts and how people follow guidelines and the discovery of new information.

I’d tell your friend to think about who has the most to gain from any given outcome and think critically about that. I’ll give you a hint. It’s not Anthony Fauci.

Start documenting things. Take videos. Whether it's you talking about your mental health in lockdown, being required to work with no safety measures, constant ambulances on the street. Document it because it's going too be put together in the future.

I would be happy to have documentation from my parents lives. And now as well, we hear about what's going on in other countries, but there's nothing like seeing it. So many things are happening and it's hard to keep track of what's real and what isn't.

It's really interesting how the message of Covid has evolved in the past few weeks. It went from "no big" deal to "hide" pretty quickly, and now even commercial messaging tells me regularly that this is the new normal. Bleh

That's only been the messaging from uninformed people. If you have always had a habit of ignoring entertainers and listen to informed people, you would have known since January at the latest that this was serious global   that would lead to an economic depression.

I agree. I was an early prepper. John Campbell on YT has been telling it as correctly as anyone, as far as I can tell since early January. I've just been aware of how the running narrative in MSM changed dramatically from week to week. I don't believe all of what is shared on Reddit either 'to be fair's (sung Letterkenny), but people here have a little more consistency.

Is the "iceberg" study about San bernadino peer reviewed? I read a "political" artical on medium that had some pretty heavy statistical analysis that I feel calls the source study into question. Namely that 2/400 false positives makes the whole data set questionable. But I'd like to read some scientific papers to confirm that

2/400 is statistically so small I would think it is well within margin of error and wouldn’t undermine the results of the study

The argument was: 2/400 is to small to assure the failure rate isn't either 0 or 1.2% and 1.2% is over half the the reported positives from the iceberg study. The problem is that both the failure and positive rate are so low that it calls into question the results of the study; a study from a skeptic with an agenda to open businesses as soon as possible...

Someone (here on reddit) pointed me to https://covidtracking.com/api which has daily information about the number of COVID19 cases and deaths (including historical). I was already aware of that data, but didn't think to share it in my original question, as it only provides some of the data needed for the gating criteria. It also doesn't exactly match https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/.

Look up your state DHHS website they will show daily tests, positive cases, etc.

Take California for example. https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/california-covid-19-hospital-data-and-case-statistics

For the ILI criteria you will need to go on CDC website. They have many interactive graphs and models that you can track and use.

Amazing study, supporting droplet (rather than aerosol) as key means of transmission. One asymptomatic person infected 10 (out of 91) at restaurant—but only if they were in direct line of air pushed by the A/C. (Aerosol would have infected others, too).

What to take away from this... don't go anywhere where they have A/C.

Because of droplets, universal and mandatory wearing of masks is one of the more efficient measures to take. Sadly some countries seem to b extremely afraid of taking those measures.

With the world severely fraked with millions having lost their jobs, and with no way to find new jobs in the face of all this, businesses, sports, entertainment etc. institutions collapsing....only within the first 4-6 weeks of the lockdown....like what the hell is the world going to look like by the time a vaccine is widely out, which is summer 2021 at the earliest? The way things are going we will have descended into cannibalism.

It will heavily depend on countries. Some implemented that government pays for most of people's salary if employer does not fire anyone. Some countries already had such a small unemployment rate, that companies could not find workers for years.

The differences in countries will further grow and those that were already heavily in debt or had huge unemployment may very likely experience a tough decade ahead of them.

On the other hand, the possible heavy reduction in globalization as the result of the pandemics could help some countries. Like Germany preferring to get goods from their eastern neighbors instead of all the way from Asia.

While complete self-sufficiency for most, especially smaller, countries is impossible these days, there will probably be attempts to have at least a near region have most essential production capacities. Apparently, these days it looks like some wild auction in China when it comes to protective equipment, countries trying to outbid each other. Plus many countries will be uncomfortable with how much power it gives China. I can see them giving priority to countries that do not have hostile relations with them.

It might be a temporary setback for them, but in the long run a benefit too. China is slowly getting into a position where they might want to turn into more of a knowledge based economy and manufacturer of added value goods instead of being the factory of cheap things. Hopefully as many countries as possible will try to use the current situation to their advantage for the future, since it is a good time to do changes.

Can anybody help me out here? Flying to another country next month. Restriction is just that I must quarantine for 14 days. I'm keen to do this anyway as my partner who lives there has asthma. How do I do this smoothly? Is it enough to stay in a single room 90% of the day, wear a mask to the bathroom, and spray everything with disinfectant afterwards? Or do I need to find somewhere to stay that isn't his house? In that case though, I'll end up coming in contact with people getting to his house after my quarantine period anyway! Would love any advice (don't travel isn't an option)

You should look at the quarantine conditions in the target country. Every country has different guidelines and rules. Somewhere it is stricter and you should not come into contact with anyone that is not part of your household. Somewhere they even put a tracker on your ankle to keep track of all your movement.

In any case, if you are infected, person living with you in the same household has quite a high chance of getting infected too.

I did this for my daughter when she came back from LA basically just go ahead and set up a room that you will be in that has all your needs so that you don’t need to come out of that room make sure you have paper cups paper plates disposable utensils garbage can even put in a hot plate and a small fridge in the room so that she didn’t even need to come out of the room she could cook and do everything inside the room. Spray everything with Lysol or wipe it down with alcohol. If you have to leave the room use a face mask and limit your mobility. She came back from LA sick and of course no testing available.

If you were flying into Canada for example you only have to isolate in your intended location. This means stay indoors and don’t go out. You only have to ‘self isolate’ in a room if you become ill or are notified you might have been exposed.

Question. Currently awaiting test results and have lots of time to think. If I test positive for the virus and have recovered beyond a doubt, is it ethical and safe to go out without wearing a mask? Seems like a lot of irritation for a measure that would be pretty much unnecessary.

From what I've read, you're probably not going to be contagious after you're fever free without aspirin for a few days. But there's no certainty that you won't catch it again, so maybe you'd want to consider a mask for your own safety.

Man if you're so hopeless that you can't read a little for yourself and come to some more educated conclusions on actual risk, actual fatality rates, immunity and vaccines then no one here can say anything to help you.

A few. The disease is pretty well manageable as long as strict countermeasures are enforced and people are disciplined, even with most of the industry open.

The vaccine should be work in progress. The immunity thing is not yet fully researched and it will take a bit longer to figure it out.

The virus also mutates, which can make it less deadly over time, since less aggressive strand is more likely to be spread more, so it propagates faster. That way the virus can turn into much less deadly disease, since strands that kill carriers fast will simply die out.

Consider the one time that someone can, and does, however. There is a story of a gas station attendant who had a customer cough on his change, say, "I hope you get Corona from this!" and toss the money at him. There are other stories as well of people purposefully putting others at risk. I certainly agree that there would be difficulty in proving that "one source" but let's be honest. There are definitely people are not social distancing, and some of them may be asymptomatic. Put those two things together, and it is possible for the worst to happen.

Oh I don't doubt someone is gonna give it to someone by refusing to social distance. I just don't see anyone wining a lawsuit over it.

One issue with the legal system is that the people with the money usually win out. If someone with the financial ability to keep a lawsuit going sues someone with less financial ability to fight back, that could be a factor. I do agree with you that it would be difficult to fight such a charge, but even those in the right lose sometimes. (Look at the Candy Crush lawsuit. The guy that invented the game that Candy Crush creators literally copied lost his house fighting when he sued them.)

I get we may be a off topic, but I can definitely see it happening in the right circumstances.

Notice how the generation that elected the current president and voted to cut public health funding are the ones overwhelmingly dying and being hospitalized. Now the entire country has to be shut down and will suffer because of their sins. They asked for this.

How do y’all feel about the news that China has seemingly manufactured the coronavirus in a lab?

I think it's possible that it was being studied in a lab and accidentally released. I think it's highly unlikely that it was manufactured in a lab. (That's what the link says, too)

You’re going to have to provide the link. Even mainstream media is not claiming it was developed in a lab just that it may have been released from a lab.

The only person I know of that has said it was man made was the guy who discovered HIV virus breakdown and he has still been controversial through the times.

Edit: Your article in the first few sentences say that this wasn’t manufactured in a lab.

Sorry, I couldn’t keep up with the edits. Honestly I don’t think you can rule it out. An accidental spreading of a virus like this surely would happen at some point. We are human after all.

How we react to this going forward would say a lot. I don’t blame China for an accident but I would blame them if they tried to cover it up. I’m open for the ideas of this happening but not a true believer until I see the evidence.

The main problem will be how governments determine the benefit of punishing a country for doing that. Countries can tell them they owe x amount of money all day but will they actually pay up? Probably not. Some might want to resort to extreme measures where death of this virus wouldn’t compare to death as a result of this virus. Others will take into consideration and move manufacturing towards home states or other countries. How that will effect the world economic standpoint I have no idea.

The story is not 'china manufactured coronavirus in a lab'.

The story is 'US intelligence investigating a rumor that china manufactured coronavirus in a lab'. There's a major difference which is unfortunately lost in all this political posturing.

Even the story itself says:

"It's a possibility, though not the most likely possibility," one official said.

This is all irresponsible reporting being put out because of pressure to find something that sticks when putting the blame on China. I mean the President can direct the intelligence community to investigate whatever he wants and it can get reported. Doesn't make it based on any facts.

Here's an even stupider version of this story put out by our Canadian 'right-leaning' newspaper - it's not even a journalistic piece, it's the barest of an opinion piece saying 'what if this were true?' https://nationalpost.com/news/why-covid-19-didnt-come-from-where-you-think-it-comes-from

It's mandatory that someone with a brand new Reddit account air this inane theory four times each day to make it seem like rational people are discussing it. We are not. We are also not discussing if this is a precursor to alien invasion, a plot by mole people to get us to mass bury some edible corpses, or a scheme by Hillary to get people to stop talking about her emails.

Do you feel the US government and prez will drop stay at home order possibly exposing to harmful COVID-19? There is some pressure from some of population. I hope not. We don’t know enough and the virus is still spreading.

Edit: I am working from home. Yes this is not preferred but safety is #1. 100% would rather work at my office when it is deemed safe.

Federal government has said it is up to the states. They released their guidelines in place to reopen a state. It’s important to note that you can add to but not take away. States still have the opportunity to remain shelter in place even if they have met the federal guidelines to loosen restrictions.

The President can say whatever he wants, it's the governors who get to decided and for the most part they are going to ignore the president and do what makes sense for their state. There are of course a few outliers who will be under intense pressure to follow the president - but I think Trump will know enough not to put the on the spot and work a way to give them cover for not opening up.

Our country have them mandatory for a simple reason. Many people spreading the virus do not have symptoms and even the ones that do have symptoms will be infectious for some two days before starting to show them.

If you yourself cannot be sure if you are the carrier of the virus, it would be irresponsible to not wear a mask. And it only takes a few minutes to stitch one together. (After spending 20 minutes to get that damn thread into the needle xD)

I don't support the lockdown "as is". I fully support a slow reopening of the country and think it's silly to try and control the uncontrollable

However, Everyone should wear the cloth mask. This is something that should become socially acceptable. If I owned a clothing company I would mass produce these with designs statements etc and make it part of current fashion

I feel fine but wear this for you

Go Packers

MAGA

Pretty design

Bad ass design

You don't always know when you are carrying the disease, they help keep you from spreading any germs you might have

Places like Japan have had masks in their culture, it's considered polite to wear a mask if you are at all under the weather

During this   for the next year or so, masks should be common

Then when it's under control it should be socially expected to wear a mask if you have the sniffles, or a cough etc

WEAR MASKS, not to protect yourself but to help protect others from   you MIGHT have

Yes. I don't leave the house without a medical grade mask and gloves. I don't get out of the car without putting them on. Nobody in my household does. We are long past 14 days isolated, but I am high risk and not taking any chances.

I expect to continue the practice for quite some time.

If everyone did that, this would be over in three weeks. But they won't.

1).So one who doesnt want to "catch " this virus will stay indoors..yet order delivered food hand made at a restaurant or pizza place by workers who are not wearing face masks ..breathing etc all over the food while being prepared. ( yes I've been in pizza places and restaurants and seen the workers....none wearing masks...with face within 3 or less feet of food)

2) politicians giving speeches without gloves or face masks..having other government officials speak intermittently..while all using the same podium...all the while giving us safety guidelines I could go on....but the irony and hypocrisy ..

This keeps getting repeated and just is not true. NY and NJ have the most confirmed cases because they have the most cases (by far) not because of testing. Just look at the hospitals and percent positive of the tests (ny/NJ are the highest)

I agree with you... It is a little bit of both. They got their testing up faster than others and their attack rate is higher than anywhere else. What I'm getting at is that other places in the USA would qualify if they got them PCR machines rolling (i.e. Detroit, Boston, New Orleans, and Chicago) would qualify if testing had been so rapidly increase as it was in the tri state area.

You're overlooking all of the people who were able to transition to working remotely. We never stopped and aren't receiving stimulus checks. I have empathy for all the rest of the smart, responsible people who lost their jobs but not their minds. The rest of you knuckle draggers are more than welcome to hole up together and work at killing each other as hard as you like.

Going outside won't kill you, whoever told you that? Going to a crowded office might though. Places doing way better than the US are seeing spikes when they try and loosen up. And they are way better at wearing masks consistently and social distancing than we are.

Some people here sound afraid of going out altogether.

As for lockdown... it depends on what it means in different countries. My country's industry and offices still work as usual with some exceptions. Public transportation with hundreds of thousands of people carried per day works too. And with all that we still got the spread under control, with new cases amounting to around 60-100 per day right now.

I read this nonsense a few days ago. No, China didn't do that.

The entire world economy, that China depends on, is heading into a deep recession and borderline depression. That's going to significantly effect China's economy over the next few years. (yes, years). There is no reality where that's a positive for China vs. the prior status quo.

Or Germany released it to kill its own people and replace them with migrants. Or Italy, to do the much needed pension reform for them! Or maybe it was UK to take off the attention from economic downfall after Brexit. Or it was US trying to kill China by releasing virus there, but it backfired! Or it is plan of our new bat overlords to subjugate humanity! #ConspiracyTime

They just had their first quarterly contraction in the modern era. That -6.8% growth represents a loss of $98 billion. That makes me very skeptical that this is all some kind of moneymaking plot for them. They were doing fine in the good times before the outbreak — why crash the train for a such a high-risk gambit, a supervillain plot?

How do we know their numbers are correct? If they mislead on Covid cases and deaths, not much of a stretch to say they might with economic numbers

Well that's a fair point. I certainly don't see any reason to believe any of China's medical numbers. But I think the nature of financial records is such that these economic reports are much more checkable — if a factory in China says it sold $100 million of product, if they're telling the truth, somewhere the other end of that transaction is written down in someone else's ledger, and we could confirm it.

Worth keeping in mind, though.

Pretty much all of their internal economy is at the whim of the CCP. So while you’re right that the economic relationship they have with western nations are probably more transparent with the numbers, they can fudge other numbers to make the narrative what they want.

I'm not sure why you think Russia and North Africa's numbers can be trusted. As far as Vietnam, they have had some experience dealing with these types of things previously.

Looking at the worldometer website,Hungary did not get their first case until the first week of March, so it may just be lagging other countries. Or their mitigation efforts are working better with a smaller population. Also, population density of Budapest, the largest city, is 8700 per square mile, much less than Greater London, which is about double that.

Residential ovens don't hit the temp range for this. Think it was between 145-155 degree F. Over that temp broke down the filtering structure of the masks and made them less effective. Kinda of a don't try this at home type of thing.

Oven baking at 170F for at least 20 min should be good, but there is a chance repeated heating might wrap the mask, if you can afford to wait, simply placing it in a paper bag and leave it alone for at least 7 days should also be enough to eliminate all virus from the mask.

Are we gonna ignore the fact that N95 masks are not just single use items from most part, but even then they are not graded to be used against viruses? Only N99/N100 (FFP3) do have efficient virus protection in their job description.

20-30 min in the oven at 70ºC could work. I also read an article that after that perhaps the mask is less effective (between 15 and 30% they said). Not sure. If you have nothing better, reuse it few times

More then likely aerolised drift. Since the virus spreads via water molecules, as far as I'm aware, I'm wondering if it can spread through rain. Basically being carried up into the atmosphere by heat and becoming part of heavy enough clouds to spread by rain

In Sum, heat destroys protein/lipid envelope and water needs heat to evaporate into clouds and whatnot.

Also, as someone who is worried about drift when spraying herbicides/pesticides droplet size is king. The compounds we are worried about drifting can survive in much smaller droplets than SARS-COV2. Again, protein envelope and sunlight and heat.

It is not airborn. It mostly spreads in droplets, that have tendency to slowly go down. It also does not survive for too long, lasting the longest on materials like plastic and even there it mostly dies off in around 3 days.

Here’s my prediction. The Midwest and northeast were on exponential growth until cooler temps hit the last week or so. Now we’ve plateaued, but once we’re seeing 70F temps again, I have a bad feeling this thing is going to spike badly. Those warmer temps are going to coincide with expanded testing and people getting tired of being at home. So nobody is going to know where to put the blame for the spike. Some will call for much more stringent lockdowns, Trump and the boys will call for opening up the economy. And people will start getting very agitated.

Or US testing labs hit their peak capacity of 150 000 tests per day, so they cannot give you more positive results even if they wanted to. The current rate of positive results is already 1 in 5 where in most countries you are closer to 1 in 10 or 1 in 20. This indicates lab shortage usually, so the true numbers may be somewhere else completely.

A person engages in domestic terrorism if they do an act "dangerous to human life" that is a violation of the criminal laws of a state or the United States, if the act appears to be intended to: (i) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.

They don't need to hurt anyone. Every person going out during a stay at home order is a walking bio-weapon.

And if strict measures were enforced and people obediently followed all rules and recommendations, they would be able to return to work that much sooner. I have a feeling that instead people will keep rebelling, ignoring recommendations and the pandemic will take that much longer, sending US economy into deep recession.

As long as there are people laughing at others for wearing masks... as long as there are people not wearing them... people blatantly throwing parties and treating this as extended vacation... US will not go back to relative normal.

I agree. A lot of people didn't have the opportunity to do that, especially living paycheck to paycheck.

And I get that puts them in a tough place.

It's just so infuriating they try to make a global pandemic political. No one is taking their constitutional freedoms away for good. We all just need to make sacrifices in times like this. If that means to sit down and shut up for a few months, then do it. COVID-19 doesn't have an agenda.

You should be safe and cancel in my opinion. By going as planned, you're not only putting yourself and your spouse in danger, but a whole bunch of people you'll be in contact with. You can always plan for other trips once the situation goes back to normal.

Don't risk infecting yourself and your environment for a few days of fun.

Younger people can sometimes be seriously ill or even killed as well...

And the main risk regarding your 'informed citizens' gathering is to spread it because of a potential asymptomatic carrier amongst you. You're not the only ones involved in the equation unless you all live in the dead middle of the Appalachians.

People like you are the problem. selfish, ignorant, small-minded people. Any group of people together is bad.

You say you don’t interact with anyone old? You don’t touch a shopping trolley, the button on the elevator, door handles? You don’t know anyone with asthma or coeliac? You don’t have any fat friends? Sleep apnea? They’re all at risk.

Can you not just stay home by yourself? There’s 161,000 reported deaths. Picture that pile of bodies. A huge part of that was because of Americans who can’t skip spring break.

Genuine question: if not now, when? Im not encouraging OP but my argument is, at some point these lockdowns are going to be lifted state by state because economically speaking we cannot afford to be shut down forever and this is exactly what 20-somethings are going to be doing, hanging out with friends they haven’t seen in weeks. They’re part of a very social age group who certainly do have a lower risk of having horrible consequences from this disease. They can’t stay away from people forever especially when a vaccine is 18 months away at least.

When the state says you can. When it’s under control, when active cases are significantly lower, which will be a whole lot sooner if people don’t be stupid now. Take the small losses now or take a bigger loss later because people refused to do the right thing in the early stages.

When will that be? Nobody knows. But I do know the more people who aren’t doing the right thing now are the ones to blame when this drags out a lot longer than need be.

The thing is is that you do not know who you will interact with. It was young people on spring break who were responsible for a very quick spread to many places around US.

What is so extremely urgent to get together for after all? Just each buy a pack of beer, get on teamspeak (Or whatever kids are using these days) or something and have some distance fun.

And no, it is not only risk for old people. While mortality rate is much smaller for young people, they still end up in hospitals. Not sure about your insurance situations, but i heard healthcare in the US is savage.

Going to hospital would also tax the already stretched out hospitals, use up more supplies and so on. Also one of the largest dangers with coronavirus is when one is fat. China had almost no dying young people, but go and find me swarms of overweight young people in China...

If you want to do get together, just go together on vacation for 2+ weeks straight without meeting anyone else... then it would be pretty safe.

I'm not saying we should all be running out to the clubs, but who thinks this is even a remotely acceptable replacement for actually getting out and socializing with people? I'm on week five of lockdown and the isolation and lack of mobility is having a severe effect on my mental health.

Perhaps because I'm not actually studying for finals and there's a massive world-altering pandemic happening outside. Plus, even when I am studying for finals I can go grab a pint with some friends to take a break or something.

Slowly, the death rate over infection is going up to 6.8% now. 160767 dead/ 2331955 case.

Recovery rate / case is at 25.6% with 597215 recovered.

I think, people like to down play the death rate. We like the 6.8% figures without realising that it does not necessarily mean 93.2% recovery. There is this 68% unresolved cases that we tend to ignore.

The death/closed case is at 21%. I reckon, we should not ignore this figure too. Down playing this part of the stats give people false view of how dangerous this covid really is. I am not saying that it's going to be 21% death rate (i really hope not!) But it's important to acknowledge both stats.

You don't counter underplaying the death rate with overplaying it. As of 4/14, of the 6,800 deaths reported by NY, 311 were under the age of 44. 258 of those deaths had an underlying condition. This is a very serious illness, but that doesn't mean you fearmonger on Reddit because you feel its not being taken seriously enough to your liking.

Depends greatly on where you live - urban or rural. And the total number of people in the US that have tested positive is still "only" about 1 in 500.

It’s all about where you live. But it’s super weird how most people barely notice it or else get super sick. I had to go to the ER for an unrelated emergency (super bad timing) and I came in while a young woman was being admitted for it. She was super loud trying to get every breath in, it sounded horrendous, she must have been terrified. She got whisked out of the ER pretty quickly. That was about a month ago, and I seem to have escaped infection at the hospital thank god.

My boss had it and is still recovering after 30 days (she's also 7 months pregnant). A friend from college also just came out of quarantine after testing positive but fortunately he only had minor symptoms.

Two of my friends now have lost a parent due to COVID-19- one of my closest high school friends lost his mother and I just learned that a colleague and friend lost his stepfather to the coronavirus.

It's out there. Be grateful it hasn't grazed your social circles and hope it never does.

Let's hope we can get the economy open soon. I'd like to see bars/restaurants/cinemas open at half capacity on May 1st. I'd like to see concerts come back, as I've missed so many in the past few months, but that would probably pose a more difficult challenge. Maybe no floor space with only every other row of seats filled? I'm about to commission some indie artists I enjoy to perform some skype concerts because I am so starved for live music.

Restaurant at half capacity doesn’t work. They already run on razor thin margins and this would mean the same overhead for half the revenue. Heard Wolfgang Puck make this argument on CNN yesterday.

You just jack the prices up and do reservations. I mean if people are just dying to go to the restaurant, they should be willing to pay or wait a few days.

If this study ends up accurate there could be 50 to 85 times more infections than currently counted. The issue with not knowing the real infection rate has been discussed continuously since January, but despite it being brought up over and over again, many people continued to state numbers like 4% fatality based on CFR.

Lmao 1 study when the rest are saying the mortality rate is higher.

Maybe if you actually read the study you'd realize it wasn't a randomized sample of the general population. They were specifically testing people that said had symptoms in the past month of COVID-19. So no   if you only test people that showed symptoms you're going to get a high return on the antibody test.

Now if they tested the general population, symptom or not, that'd be a different story. But once again morons can't read and latch on to anything to make a nonexistent point.

What studies are saying the mortality rate is higher? I’ve seen several that point to a lower mortality rate. This is a very serious situation, don’t get me wrong, but evidence is showing that many more people have it than are being tested for it

If this was a fact, it would make coronavirus on par with the seasonal flu in terms of mortality, which is around 0.1%



Most other studies are at the lowest estimating a 0.3% mortality rate, most estimates hover around 1%, and then you have some far end estimates at 2-5%.



Also take a look at the comment I just posted regarding the sampling of this study. Or take a look at the actual study yourself, there's plenty of flaws and no reason to draw any conclusions from it.

Except there are also more deaths than reported. Nobody is saying it isn’t worse than the flu, it just doesn’t have a 5% death rate. It’s probably lower than 2% as well. The serological studies in the US are very new but there were similar findings in Italy and Iceland.

No, this study assumption that there are 50 to 85 times more people infected points to the conclusion that the mortality rate is of the seasonal flu.

Current case fatality in the US is around 5%. This study is saying there are 50 times more cases in reality.

1/20 -> 1/(20X50) -> 1/1000 = 0.1%

0.1% is the same mortality rate of the seasonal flu.

This study doesn't talk about any additional deaths, and yeah I agree the deaths are undercounted. I'm just talking about the study's assumptions and the conclusions people are drawing from it.

I don't see anything in the study saying they were testing people with symptoms. Where do you see that? I'm reading that they recruited people across Santa Clara county who volunteered for the study, this was an antibodies test. From the study..

Study Participants and Sample Recruitment

We recruited participants by placing targeted advertisements on Facebook aimed at residents of Santa Clara County. We used Facebook to quickly reach a large number of county residents and because it allows for granular targeting by zip code and sociodemographic characteristics. We used a combination of two targeting strategies: ads aimed at a representative population of the county by zip code, and specially targeted ads to balance our sample for under-represented zip codes. In addition, we capped registrations from overrepresented areas. Individuals who clicked on the advertisement were directed to a survey hosted by the Stanford REDcap platform, which provided information about the study. The survey asked for six data elements: zip code of residence, age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying co-morbidities, and prior clinical symptoms. Over 24 hours, we registered 3,285 adults, and each adult was allowed to bring one child from the same household with them (889 children registered).

Not sure if you read the actual study or just the abstract, but there are some major holes in this study. First of all, they're recruiting using Facebook ads. They don't show the ads, and assuming the ad goes along the lines of "want to know if you had covid?", you're probably going to recruit more people that think they had covid due to symptoms they exhibited in the last 2 months.

The survey asked for six data elements: zip code of residence, age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying comorbidities, and prior clinical symptoms.

They collected prior clinical symptoms data but never go on to discuss it in their results section. Unless you see it elsewhere, it doesn't look like they posted the raw data to see if most people reported they had symptoms or if it was a mix of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.

There should be anti-body tests that come out eventually. I think I may have it or had it, but it is hard to tell, thankfully because if I do have it the symptoms are mild and come and go. I am eager to get an anti-body test once the situation has settled down - hopefully for your sake you did have it and got over it.

It's possible, but not too likely. Even people who had most of the typical Covid symptoms test negative 80% of the time. And you could be asymptomatically positive right now. Basically the safest thing to do is to act like you still have it so other's don't catch it from you, but also act like you don't have it so you don't catch it from others.

So, I'm really wondering what's with the Mortality Rate of this virus being all over the place. Currently it has a mortality rate of 6.6% (146k deaths over 2.2m infections). However, China had a mortality rate of only 3%, our country (the Netherlands) state its mortality rare is only 1.6%, and some German scientists calculated its mortality is (or will be) a mere 0.3125%. What's with all these different rates all over the place? None of the scientifically reported numbers currently reflect what is actually happening.

Those are total Corona deaths, not total "any" deaths.

Also, these numbers are very, very far off, because the correct rate would imply that somehow/somewhere in the world we're 8 MILLION reported infections short (taking the 1.6% lethality rate. That number would even be higher of taking the 0.3% rate for granted.)

And a ton of people have had bad symptoms and still couldn't get tested. There was an article on a former Auburn players mother who had it and she had to fight just to get a test.

When you factor in asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases, the mortality rate is closer to ~0.657%

Their CI is 0.389-1.33.

Quoting a number from a paper without including the error is disingenuous.

Took a bit to read, but that article is nowhere neither theorizing, calculating or proving that there are to date 22.2 MILLION a-symptomatic cases. 146.000 deaths on a 0.657% mortality rate means there's 22.2 million cases to derive that number from, and you're saying that only 10% of ALL cases is symptomatic? Sounds very wild, TBH, for how aggressive it has been spreading and scientifically detected/caught up. Even prior calculations don't even come to a quarter of that number, and most countries have been acting the moment the leak came from China.

Jeez, no need to go all sassy about it. All I said is that your provided source does not even closely talk about, prove, or contribute to your claim of that there's 18-20 million asymptomatic infections. Only that they 'exist' in a low degree.

That is something truly unknown. If you don’t test, you can’t know for sure. The Lancet paper used modeling. But models are only as good as the assumptions you put into the front end.

count your mortality rate compared to closed cases, because you don't know whether the living ones will keep living or die trying.

also, once you finish with that add XX% for asymptomatic cases and you have a close death rate

That will A, only amplify ratio's, and B, be unrealistic since cases only close past 2 weeks and deaths happen much earlier than most other cases have resolved.

You can't assume that the 600000 is citizens with it will all survive. The graph will edge downward in percent but it will never hit deaths / total cases until everything is said and done.

In my country some smaller distilleries tried to do the same. They delivered to hospitals and government buildings, giving it to them for free. The government slammed them with police visit and order to stop it, since they did not have permission to manufacture sanitizers. Flexible crisis management at its brightest. xD

When someone has it and two weeks pass, will they just immediately feel better on the day of the 2nd week or might it take longer to recover like say 2 weeks and 4 days for example

I had it for two weeks. This thing is brutal and I am shape but takes a toll on your body. After it leaves your body it is trying so hard to repair its self. My wife struggled with it. The scary thing is having a cough that prevents you from sleeping and having sleep apnea at the same time. Man I don’t wish this virus on anyone. The thing about it will mask itself like a cold but you would think is just than then your just getting all these crazy symptoms out of nowhere.

It can take up to 4 weeks in some rare cases. Of course if it damages one's lungs, they may need hospitalization for even longer until the lungs manage to heal.

I can only imagine how scary the thought of a month long hospitalization must be for non-insured or under-insured Americans.

Depends where the particular strain is from. German or Japanese viruses make it a point to always leave their host after exactly 2 weeks, down to a few minutes, whereas say Carribean strains basically go away when they feel like it.

Is there any sign that the virus will mutate like the Spanish Flu and have an even worse Second Wave? I was reading up that a lot of factors were at play for why the second wave was deadly, and other than not being at war, I am seeing some similarities. Even if idiots are protesting the lockdown, will it be worse than 1919?

There are already several mutations of the virus. But the opposite is more likely. Deadly viruses have the tendency to mutate into less deadly versions. If it kills hosts too fast, it deprives itself of a chance to spread... so versions that make people walk around with it as if nothing get to propagate more, thus giving the less deadly version an evolutionary advantage. Especially with strict quarantines for sick people.

There is already what they call type A, type B and type C with slightly mutated genome. I think the main research is being done by Dr. Peter Forster from Cambridge university. Not sure if they wrote a proper research paper on it yet, but there were interviews with them.

For the speculations on the future of coronavirus I mostly used interviews with microbiologists for our academy of sciences in our national public TV, sadly they are not in English.

If a second wave is worse, it will likely be because people refuse to obey containment measures. Viruses typically mutate to be less deadly. If a virus is more deadly it has a harder time spreading because hosts die too quickly

I suppose it's better than nothing, but some people have complained about how our Governor in Cali isn't doing much, am I missing something here?

In terms of how we are rn in California, what do you think we would all return back to our regular lives soo ner than later? It seems like some people aren't satisfied with what gov Newsom is doing. I want to know what hes accomplished and as of rn from what I heard on the news, it seems he wants us to stay inside still after trump Twitted that every govern in every state is on there own. Maybe I'm missing something on the information that maybe you guys might see something I don't, I'm just asking since again I feel like I'm missing something

Prosecution for disease transmission is a real thing, but you need to prove it was intentional, and you need to prove it actually came from the accused. With HIV, it has sometimes produced a conviction when people gave it to their sexual partner. But with this worldwide pandemic? Good luck ever actually proving beyond a reasonable doubt that person A is actually the one who infected person B. I don't see how you make that case successfully.

IANAL.

Let’s say a married couple, no kids. Both have not left the house in a month, and have methodically cleaned all deliveries they’ve received and neither have been sick recently or have shown symptoms.

Husband is a Trump supporter, finally decides to leave the house and join the protest, despite the wife’s pleas of staying inside.

Husband still goes out, gets infected in the protest but is asymptomatic and then infects his wife as well. Neither leave the house again until the wife is rushed to hospital 14 days later and eventually passes away.

But before she passes, she lets her parents know that they only time they were exposed outside was when her husband went to the protest. Parents now want to sue husband for wrongful death.

Any merit to the circumstantial evidence or this lawsuit gets thrown out?

I think this is the only way it could possibly work. Locked-room scenario.

But in this case, you also gotta consider... does the content of the thing the husband went to matter any more? Let's say in a few months, we get loads of these cases. Sometimes the husband accidentally hurt himself and went to the emergency room and got it at the hospital. Sometimes the plumbing broke and the husband went to the hardware store and got it there. Sometimes the husband went to a C.o.m.m.u.n.i.s.t Party of America meeting and got it there. And sometimes it was a protest against the lockdowns. And sometimes it was because he went to vote. Or to a job interview.

How much does it matter what the one exposure was? Do we only prosecute the cases where it was a political thing? And if so, do we only prosecute the ones where it was right-wing politics? Political speech is the most protected kind of speech — it seems super weird to single out just that!

It gets into difficult areas for sure.

Interesting. Do you have a law background?

This from the other user’s wikipedia link.

The accused is a social danger because they have endangered the safety of others in circumstances where the reasonable person would have foreseen the injury and taken preventive measures. Hence, the test is hybrid.

There’s gotta be a bunch of Personal Injury lawyers looking into this right now.

10 new cases is way too strict. US healthcare should without an issue handle at least 1000 to 3000 new cases per day nationwide.

My country has up to 8 years prison for willful spread, up to $120 000 fine for breaking of ordered quarantine. And some $500 for not wearing masks.

"Civil unrest". I find it notable that despite long lines at food banks, the only threats or glimpses of violence so far are from people toting rifles (and waving Confederate flags) in places like Michigan. For the most part, people, including those who have been financially affected, have been great about cooperating and working together to limit the spread and support each other. If there's violence in the US, it'll be because there is a minority of political extremists who have been itching to set things off violently for some time.

You're missing something crucial. The goal of the shutdown isn't primarily to flatten the curve for medical facilities to catch up, it's primarily to buy enough time for medical research to find the most effective medicine, testing methods, treatments and developing vaccines.

I’m not disagreeing with you and it’s hard to find that was European countries plans to buy time. I was only aware of not creating an overwhelm system. We still haven’t made any real breakthroughs in medicine, and European countries are slowly starting to reopen faster than the US is.

Well, true. Fact is that we bought ourselves lots of time to help medical services and equipment catch up with what we need (In fact, the amount of hospitalized cases is steadily reducing here in the Netherlands), and have already found a couple of leads for treatments to help people cure from it. But the tunnel is still very long.

I know many politicians forget it in today's realtime age, but most admin workers do not work during weekends and late Friday afternoons, so there are weakly cries about how 'we hit the peak!' and 'It is now going down!' only for there to be disappointment during Monday.

Look at weekly trajectories instead of going by days and hours. Usually is more telling.

Those evil conspiracies! I think it is closer to 150 000 though. They should be able to squeeze out a bit more if they mobilize universities and all other places with suitable labs.

I have a rash on my waist, back, stomach and chest, some red dots cane to my neck. It is not itchy though. Could this be Covid-19?

Please ask a doctor if you're concerned enough or at least check a list of symptoms on a website you can trust, how do you expect randos on the Internet to diagnose a novel strain of virus with two sentences of description?

Yes, and if you search for symptoms like thirst, headache etc. online, you will probably start thinking you actually have cancer. Until something is actually seriously wrong with your body, affecting you in a major way, just ignore it, or treat it like you normally would. Panicking and seeing evil disease everywhere does not help anyone and crazy people swarming test places and hospitals only add to the workload, harming other people indirectly. Plus going to get tested probably exposes you to chance of getting infected more than anything else you do during your days, so just don't unless you really need to.

Do nothing. Wear mask. Stay away from people. That's about it. Simple and if everyone followed that, countries would not be struggling right now.

Actually rashes have been added as one of the symptoms and possibly an early warning of infection. Several articles have been written in the topic in the last few days.

If my conversion tool works, then 98.5 is not even a fever yet, but close to fairly natural body temperature?

But the fact that there is such a huge backlog of tests is quite worrying. No wonder the politicians think US hit the peak, if there is not more reported cases because of no more lab capacities.

The reported numbers always go down a lot during weekends. Not all labs test 24/7, not all institutions have administrative staff in to report things. And almost every weekend the politicians come out saying how there are 'signs of numbers dropping' and 'end of pandemic is near' without ever realizing that it is a goddamn weekend.

For example, Look at the Swedish death statistics. Yes, the periodic drops are weekends.

The US Gov needs to pass a law making it reckless endangerment of a minor or premeditated attempted murder to bring an underaged child to a grocery store (or any public place) without a face mask during a declared health risk. 10 year minimum fed pen time without the possibility of parole and permanent loss of custodial rights for first offense, no exceptions.

This is killing people and just because they dont believe in vaccinations shouldn't allow them to think that everything done for their health is fake and made up. I had controlled angry conversations with several parents bringing kids to the store without masks these last couple of weeks and each one mentioned refusing to get their children vaccinated in addition to making fun of me for wearing a mask and "talking funny with that stupid thing on my face". They all laughed at me and said this whole thing was made up (8 different families) I just hope that their kids start to question them as more and more people speak up about their stupidity.

Underage children are mostly safe from the virus so far, apart from a few very rare cases though.

Thumbs up for mandatory mask wearing though. My country does it, works well.

But most countries think about reopening kindergartens and schools at least to some degree exactly because children are the least endangered category with this virus.

If you have 12 year old, make them do all the family shopping on their own to keep the family safe. xD

OK so, I'm not in the US and face masks aren't a thing here - infact guidelines are saying not to wear a face mask and leave them for healthcare professionals and essential workers.

Not saying you're wrong but the beginning sounds a bit steep? Also small children can't wear masks for safety reasons and also, the thought of trying to keep a mask on my toddler already gives me PTSD.

Vaccines have not been tested for carcinogen potential, mutation potential, or for impairment of fertility. Why are people so willing to take them? When people take the flu vaccine, they still get the flu.

Maybe because there are very nasty diseases that can wipe out millions of people? And vaccines like the TBC vaccine that has been around for a century, can be given to 4 day old babies, has pretty much no recorder downsides and people have been using them for decades without issues and one dose gives you lifelong immunity? Just a guess that occasional light fever or rash sound a bit better than millions dying. But who knows... it could be anything!

No the virus only kills old and the sick so why is all of America shutting down our economy can’t hold out for 3 more months we will get it at some point in sure that’s why we have immune system‘s so stop wearing masks that don’t do anything for you and stop looking at social media and the news for updates they don’t do anything except lye to you did you know a few weeks ago the Congress gave them self a $40,000 raise so while people are out of a job and aren’t making money there giving themselves more money

Why don't world governments and the World Health Organization put more emphasis on the Coronavirus driving the human race to near extinction? I'm not saying I believe the virus will do such a thing, but for once, let's see a tv commercial or something that features a dinosaur skeleton with the slogan, "This is our future if don't do anything about it." I want to hear President Trump use the word "extinction" in a future conference. Something like "The coronavirus will not drive us to extinction."

Even if nobody did anything to defend or prepare, and the worst-case scientific models happened, the human race would not be anywhere close to extinction. You could imagine a semi-plausible absolute worst case scenario where governments and societies collapse across the globe, but even then we're not looking at extinction.

I don't mean this as a joke, but if you're talking about restricting (i) people with an overweight BMI, (ii) people over 65, (iii) smokers and (iv) people with pre-existing health conditions that put them at risk, you are, in fact, talking about restricting over 50% of the US population. In many states, it may be over 75%. So that doesn't really move the ball very much.

the economy wouldn't be fine at all though. Remember, 1/4 of those with COVID need to be hospitalized! Forget about the death rate. Think of the hundreds of thousands that would be flooding our hospitals and taking off of work for more than a month. No company can survive when a good chunk of your workforce is either sick or dying. And this is especially true today since so many positions are based on specific skills/education/body of knowledge. It's not like 50 yrs ago when the labor force was composed of interchangeable factory workers.
