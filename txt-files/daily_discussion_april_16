If the number of tests goes down, in NY for example, do we take it to mean there are less tests available or less requests? How do we discern the cause?

Beware of people interpreting Trump's latest comments about re-opening the country as a license to go back to their old habits right away. If people start gathering again too soon, an outbreak will follow and we'll end up in a longer lockdown.

Honestly, thank god most states are still keeping restaurants and bars closed, so people don't have a place to "go out."

I'm worried about some states, but there's not much to be done beyond calling their governors' offices a lot. They will have to see for themselves how their case counts skyrocket.

Politics is a dirty and dangerous business, isn't it?

I don't think those Governors care. Evidenced by the fact that they are pushing to open up too early and  f***ing us all in the process.

General appreciation right now for my local leaders in being on top of social distancing measures and us stopping from our resources being overloaded. Glad were not filling up mass graves or neighbors leaving their dead out from lack of people to pick them up. They truly saved us when it was a hard decision

My father had contact from a distance with a confirmed case at his work about 9-11 days ago. Since I live with him, I know that I need to stay isolated. Should I reset the isolation period for today because that is when he found out?

How bad is it to still go jogging daily? I live in a large city, so it's very hard to find anywhere completely without people though I've done my best. Other than exercising I haven't left my apartment. I live in a tiny upstairs studio so indoor exercise options are pretty impossible.

As long as you are not sick and it's permitted in your area, I think the benefit of jogging outweight the risks, but some researchers are saying that you need to give people more than 6 feet clearance when jogging because droplets can have a trailing effect, just do your best - like turning back and jog the other way when you really can't avoid closeness. Take care!

As long as you stay away from other people and away from closed areas you should be fine.

Just remember while jogging, you're spraying droplets everywhere and breathing heavily, so if you're sick (or have covid without knowing it) you're going to be infecting others, and if you're jogging by people who are sick, you're going to be breathing in their air, so vice versa.

Having some sort of face covering will help but it'll make jogging unpleasant. Up to you how much you value safety over exercise.

It's nice to have a relatively large drug study from the US out. Let's hope the studies continue to back up remdesivir.

It's not out yet though... It's just rumors they are set to publish at the end of the month.

Just fyi for those downvoting this from the NY Times:

"Gilead, in an emailed statement, said "the totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial."

UChicago Medicine, also in an email, said "partial data from an ongoing clinical trial is by definition incomplete and should never be used to draw conclusions." "

I hope it's as good as being reported but what I said is true. There is no published large study like OP referenced.

Everyone around me, even people in the same bank as me, has gotten their stimulus. I'm not sure whether I will be getting it. Last year I was filed as a dependent on my mom (to save her some money on taxes, I was still a student at the time; am 25 years old). This year I filed as independent, did so in early March. What do you guys think? Will I not get it because I filed as a dependent for 2018? Just a coincidence everyone else around me has gotten theirs but mine is still coming?

If you go to irs.gov then click "coronavirus" you can get an update on your status, and there's even a section there to put in your bank info for direct deposit. If you wait for a physical check, it will take a long time because T-rump wants to sign them all personally.

Tried that. Tried putting SSN in with and without dashes. Tried all potential addresses, because I've moved around a bit past couple years. Every single variation said either no payment status available or please try again later (aka in 24 hours). Guess I'll give it another go tomorrow

I want everything to go back to normal but I‚Äôm scared that the governor and president are caving to public outcry and opening everything up too soon. I‚Äôm terrified honestly. I feel like things will open back up and the virus will run rampant again and numbers will go back up. What does everyone else think?

I agree with you. I think we have yet to hit the peak everywhere, and if everyone rushes back to the old normal, numbers will start increasing again. Worse, we aren't sure whether people can get infected a second time.

This was a tragic decision, motivated only by greed and ego. In a sane country, Glorious Leader would be marched out of the Oval Office in leg irons.

Saw a poll that only 10% want to open before health officials recommend. 80% are willing to let public health take priority. We have a vocal minority, but the idea of opening too early is not popular thankfully

I‚Äôm in the south of the United States and if it‚Äôs a minority, they‚Äôre very loud as well. All I see are people bashing the governor and demanding he open everything back up right now and I‚Äôm so afraid that he‚Äôs going to cave to public pressure, especially after what Trump said. I feel like I‚Äôm becoming an agoraphobe because even when stuff opens up, I don‚Äôt think I can bring myself to go anywhere. People haven‚Äôt been following the guidelines

China revised their numbers to include some earlier deaths where Covid was the probable cause but testing was not available. Other countries have done the same before. This is encouraging. Their reported domestic new cases and imported new cases have not changed significantly (26 new cases, no deaths today).

I wish database websites would assign those numbers to the day of actual death instead of dump them all into the day of reporting. Worldometer sounds like they are planning to do this at some point, but in the mean time it really mess up their graphs.

I've started a petition to help raise awareness for people suffering with mental health issues throughout this lockdown period.

In the petition I've also mentioned the creation of a platform on Twitter and Instagram for people that may need to open up and have a chat about their problems.

I would greatly appreciate if you could share or even just sign the petition below and follow the account @lockdownpal on Twitter and Instagram to help me spread the word.

Why do you need a petition? What country are you in?

In Australia it is widely talked about by government and media.

You probably just need to create awareness.and write.to political members I don't see.what a petition will achieve.

It's being used in limited, very much targeted compassionate cases, where nothing else works. And even then, it's not trialed for use yet, so we need more data.

I will begrudgingly trade my privacy for less death and illness but... anyone else concerned about all those dna tests people were doing combined with the contract tracing? This administration depravity has no bounds and there are lots of ways this can be exploited.

I feel like I understand what you are saying and it is a legitimate concern. Do people who consent to COVID serology testing specify that the data will be used for COVID testing and nothing else? The new tests are bypassing FDA approvals right now.

Where is this data? It does not seem to match Worldometer reports. They have the peak so far at 130 deaths for April 15. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/

They are asking people to report possible covid deaths that were not confirmed by lab test back in the day. So let‚Äôs say someone died from covid and had all covid symptoms but did not get tested due to test kit shortage or doctor thought it was just a flu, this person would not be considered as a ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù case because there is no lab test to confirm. But he/she is considered as a ‚Äúprobable‚Äù case.

Now China is getting the number of those ‚Äúprobable‚Äù cases.

Lets hope it is an actual drop as well and not just lag in reporting the numbers. I think it is safe to say that they have stopped increasing, but a bit too early to celebrate an actual decline.

the lag is consistently adding deaths even as far back as 7+ days. So that whole week that shows the decline is not fully reported yet.

Here's a good visualisation of the lag and guesstimate on where the numbers are more likely to end up: https://adamaltmejd.se/covid/

Thought I'd share what I'm dealing with right now...... I am currently on a 14 day quarantine for suspected COVID. Since I am not running a persistent fever I do not meet the guidelines to be tested, but will be treated as a presumptive positive. I have been ill for 4 days now. It started with a sore throat and and progressed to a mild cough, fatigue, body aches and shortness of breathe. I was diagnosed via telemedicine. I was asked not to visit a medical facility unless my symptoms worsen. I have family in the medical field so I have access to a hospital grade pulse ox. My saturation has gone from a consistent 98 down to 94. I am NOT running a fever. It went up slightly to 100 degrees at the onset, but has been quite low since (averaging 97.2). I feel AWFUL but functional. The worst is the fatigue. I'm exhausted after walking down my stairs and I'm sleeping about 16 hours a day. I've already had the flu this season and this is far worse.

There is an independent living facility 3 blocks from my home that currently has four seniors testing positive. We have a small grocery store in our neighborhood that they frequent, so its entirely possible I was exposed there. Additionally as I said, I have family in medicine that have been around a number of people who were exposed. My husband has experienced no symptoms, nor have our children. I have an underlying health problem (atrial septal defect) that may attribute. It would be nice to be certain if this was COVID or not but honestly it wouldn't make the treatment any different. Our State is still struggling with tests and I wouldn't want to take one away from someone who needs it far more than me. For now I just hunker down and keep drinking my fluids.

I'm not a medical person, but have you talked to your medical relatives at what point you should seek treatment? 94 o2 saturation seems pretty low to me. I'm glad you have your family with you to help take care of you. I'll be praying for you üôè for a swift recovery.

I live in a region of Finland which doesnt have many cases, and Finland as a whole has around 3500. Now I haven't gone to the gym for 3 weeks, and since my gym is a private gym it is still open. I was wondering: Would it still be safe to go if I sanitize everything, dont touch my face and keep a distance from others? This shit has made me paranoid

I think they have plenty of money. They are big publicly traded pharmaceutical companies that are getting hundreds of millions from our governments and foundations like bill gates foundation. IMO food kitchens, your local ymca or boys and girls clubs, homeless shelters, meals on wheels type organizations need all the help they can get.

Don't shave. Shaving results in microscopic skin cuts that leave the skin vulnerable to microbes, including bacteria and viruses. Even a small skin infection - one you may never notice - activates your body's immune system for that specific issue; the more issues your body needs to fight, the easier it is for your immune system to become overwhelmed.

No you could cut yourself shaving and get an infection and that would be more dangerous. Hair can actually keep bacteria away from our pores and other potential entry points. Definitely get a scrubby thing to gently exfoliate with a body wash all the dead skin dirt and oil. Not too hard or scratchy or again you risk getting a rash and infection!

Be wary of everything that works in a petri dish. The human body is an extremely complex organ that, 99% of the time, does not recapitulate these in vitro studies.

It has been said that we have cured cancer in a petri dish many lifetimes over.

And it's true!

Have you ever wondered why we still have cancer, since every week we come out with better and better things to cure it in cells? The answer is not that "BigPharma is evil and wants to keep you sick."

It's that 90% of these drugs fail in clinical trials. (and honestly that's probably an underestimate, since Pharma doesn't usually report negative trials).

Abs: 'Kaempferol, a very common type of dietary flavonoids, has been found to exert antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of our investigation was designed to reveal the effect of kaempferol on H9N2 influenza virus-induced inflammation in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, BALB/C mice were infected intranasally with H9N2 influenza virus with or without kaempferol treatment to induce acute lung injury (ALI) model. In vitro, MH-S cells were infected with H9N2 influenza virus with or without kaempferol treatment. In vivo, kaempferol treatment attenuated pulmonary edema, the W/D mass ratio, pulmonary capillary permeability, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the numbers of inflammatory cells. Kaempferol reduced ROS and Malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Kaempferol also reduced overproduction of TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6. In addition, kaempferol decreased the H9N2 viral titre. In vitro, ROS, MDA, TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6 was also reduced by kaempferol. Moreover, our data showed that kaempferol significantly inhibited the upregulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphorylation level of IŒ∫BŒ± and nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) p65, NF-Œ∫B p65 DNA binding activity, and phosphorylation level of MAPKs, both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that kaempferol exhibits a protective effect on H9N2 virus-induced inflammation via suppression of TLR4/MyD88-mediated NF-Œ∫B and MAPKs pathways, and kaempferol may be considered as an effective drug for the potential treatment of influenza virus-induced ALI.'

Not legit. I mean it's true in the sense that more air coming directly out of your mask means you will likely spread more virus.

But not legit in that it isn't a good cutoff. Masks that won't let you blow out the candle can still be not very useful.

Hold your mask up to the light.

The best and most useful thing to know is that more light = more virus.

There isn't a cutoff because N95s are the real cutoff. And we need to save those for physicians and nurses that may take care of you or your relatives in the ICU.

Someone forwarded a YouTube video and some articles about this. Pretty much instantly thought it sounded fishy, but I'd like a more educated opinion before I tell people forwarding this video that "Hey, it's fake, just like all other forwards".

So the town I'm living in reports daily numbers for Covid-19 to keep us informed. The last time I checked was three weeks ago and reported cases were on 281. I checked today and they are on 289 now. I thought it would increase much more so I'm happy to actually see a slower outburst myself. Of course these numbers are still bad but "only" 8 more cases in three weeks in a 30k town? I think that is a small success. Our local hospital also states that their ICU is running up well and is not overloaded and also Covid-19 patients recover pretty well. So far we have 8 confirmed deaths here with the last one being reported somewhere around end of March/start of April if I remember correctly. No new deaths were reported since then.

Call me crazy but in times like this I consider these news as rather "good" news. (Germany, Bavaria btw)

Could an irritated bleeding uvula be a warning sign of Covid-19 as it's a common symptom of streptococcus or flu?

I've had both of those before and I've never had my uvula bleed..

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the virus, the heightened media attention that the city and China on a whole have received has led to anti-Chinese sentiment across the world.

This anti-Chinese sentiment has resulting in people of Asian descent at large to become victims of discrimination, prejudice, racism and abuse. This racist behavior has been fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories, mostly spread over social media, as well as discriminatory language used by political leaders and media commentators.

If this is how China operates, and delivers new "unreported" deaths and cases from Wuhan, then what can we actually expect from this regime? This is clear proof that their numbers are simply low as sh*t at best. They can use the same B.S. and come up 2 weeks from now with 3.000 unreported deaths and 15000 new cases because hey, we just did not want to report them in time.

Makes me sick.

Every country has been adding estimates of "probable cases" to their confirmed cases. China took longer than most, which is reasonable given that they were the origin country and by far the least prepared, testing wasn't available at all until they were almost halfway through their epidemic, but the fact that they revised the numbers at all is encouraging, and it's possible they might add more numbers later.

we've been using china's numbers to predict numbers from elsewhere and the rates line up with other countries numbers. unlikely. if they were faking... well then they probably saw into the future or sth.

did something happen. From china i heard their new cases are mostly imported cases.

It could be they're cleverly reporting their numbers in a way to reflect the proportion without the total number of cases. I.E. they reported 100 deaths and 20,000 infections when in reality it was 100000 deaths and 2,000,000 infections

Then the exponential growth would have a way higher rate. But it does not. We'd have known easily if theres an explosion like that. Their quarantine measures and timeline to lift them would also be dead giveaways.

The seeming inability of the world to get serological testing on a wider scale is very disappointing to me. Simply put, we cannot fight an enemy we don't know. The ramifications of dealing with a virus with a 2% mortality rate that has only infected 10% of even the worst affected hotspots, and one with a 0.5% mortality rate that has infected almost a third of, say, NYC (you can do the simple maths via extrapolating death rate) are wildly different and require different policies.

Clinics in Wuhan is reporting thousands of antibody tests done per day and ramping up pretty quickly, cost is only $25 USD per test so I am optimistic that this means serological testing is scalable and affordable. The USA had a late start, but it also has a long history of catching up to other countries and outperforming them once it gets over the initial screw-ups. Wuhan is doing the serology test for return-to-work purposes (not research) but there is a large scale study in Chine in 11 other provinces, and hopefully they will release the data in a timely fashion.

I have been following all of them and they all point towards the 0.5% mortality or even far lower hypothesis. But they are simply not on a large enough scale to be able to correctly extrapolate with any degree of real confidence.

It would take nothing more than a single set of a thousand tests with a proper random sample in Lombardy or NYC or Madrid to allow us to have a far greater confidence level about the situation. It is incredible that this has not been done yet. I completely understand that these hotspots have other priorities, but this is vital for the entire world to understand how to best start lifting lockdowns.

I believe the CDC is working NYC and a few other areas now. We did have the blood donors studies in Scotland n=1000, and Danish one n=7000 I believe. Can't wait to see more results but everything points toward a pretty sizeable population of asymptomatic/mild cases.

The time to do it was a month ago. I am willing to bet a significant amount of actual money that at least a quarter of NYC is infected. I ask you, what sense does it make to keep a full lockdown if herd immunity and social distancing does half your job for you? I am by no means saying to lift everything and continue life as usual, I am just saying that this extremely important data must guide the actions of people.

Anyway, we here can do nothing but wait for the data to come out.

Some redditor who claimed to be a researcher from Seattle was saying their data is in, but they are not allowed to release it yet, if this is true, I will optimistically guess that this means that the "Iceberg Theory" is correct and governments are worried that if they report that a significant portion of the population is probably immune then lots of dumb people are going break social distancing and then hospitalizations will spike.

I wish I could find it, but I saw an article where the researcher was talking about their Seattle data and claiming they'd have NY data "within a week" - and this was at least a week ago, mind you! - but saying they weren't going to release the data because "blood donors aren't an accurate sample." If I find that article I'll edit it into here.

I'm legitimately starting to believe what you said, yeah.

Literally got a stalker from this subreddit because I DARED express frustration and disappointment at my life being completely turned upside down. Because clearly since my loved ones aren't sick or worse I'm not allowed to be slightly annoyed I have to order plants online, or all of my summer plans this year are possibly ruined.

How I feel about this situation is valid, and I'm allowed o not like this. I'm sorry to everyone else who tries to be optimistic and express frustration and gets consistently downvoted in this sub.

No, it's not. I was talking about the idea of the governors of certain states not allowing superstores to sell "non-essential" products that they already have in stock being rather stupid; edible plants at the very least should be allowed to be sold, and I think the idea of physically not being able to buy something that you could literally walk two aisles over and buy doesn't really make much sense. That just wasn't a good way to put it.

The POINT of the actions we're taking is that they're drastic and painful. Also the idea that livelihood is never on the level of life is so insane. You're literally talking about people losing months to years of progress in their life trying to get their life together that are putting it on hold for everyone else, and people really should be appreciative of the sacrifice.



The anti optimism is the biggest cancer on this sub. You're allowed to look at the data and take the lowball estimates seriously.

Could Coronavirus have been the cause of the recent outbreak of "Vaping Related Lung Disease"?

The symptoms seem very similar.

Symptoms typically develop over a period of days but sometimes can manifest over several weeks.[17] Many cases, patients reported a gradual start of symptoms, including: breathing difficulty, shortness of breath, and/or chest pain before hospitalization.[18] Based on reports from several states, patients have experienced respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain), and some have also experienced gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) or non-specific symptoms (fatigue, fever, or weight loss).[2] Some cases reported mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness.[18] Some patients have reported that their symptoms developed over a few days, while others have reported that their symptoms developed over several weeks.[2] Some patients have reported gastrointestinal symptoms began before respiratory symptoms.[2] Fever, elevated heart rate, and elevated white blood cell count have been reported, even though no infectious disease has been identified.[2] Many patients sought medical care in ambulatory settings, sometimes over several visits, before they were admitted to the hospital.[2]

Many patients have required medical treatment with supplemental oxygen.[2] Some required assisted ventilation.[2] Some patients have been treated with corticosteroids with demonstrated improvement.[2] Evidence does not suggest an infectious disease is the cause of the severe pulmonary disease.[2] Antibiotic therapy alone has not consistently been associated with clinical improvement.[2] A handful of individuals have been re-admitted for clinical care after discharge for lung injury.[20] The CDC does not know whether individuals who were re-admitted continued or restarted use.[20] The range of time that the CDC is aware of for these re-admissions ranges from approximately five days after discharge to 55 days after discharge.

The disease came out of nowhere and disappeared shortly before Corona cases started appearing.

The cases are related to THC vape use, not nicotine vapes. Nicotine down regulates the ACE receptors, which Coronavirus attaches to, and may cause nicotine smokers to suffer less sever symptoms. That is, maybe it was related to vapes in general, but nicotine vape users were just not strongly affected.

Many of these vape products were made in China and it's possible that quality control for some vape makers might simply entail a worker at the end of an assembly process taking a few drags off a vape device (contaminating it) before dropping it in a box for shipment.

Much more likely to be coincidental than anything else...

If 6 people died of the vaping thing, then ~600 people would have been sick overall. It's very hard to imagine that wouldn't have resulted in an outbreak much sooner than we've seen.

Perhaps some of the common components of vape liquid could have helped preserve viral particles. Glycerine, a common ingredient, has been used to preserve viral samples:

Glycerol has been used for a long time as a viral preservation medium in tissue samples at a 50 per cent concentration,

Perhaps other components like Vitamin E would help as well.

All just odd guesses though.

My aunt works on a Covid Ward in the UK. She has said everyone on the ward over 75 years old as well as other people within the community over 75 and with heart conditions (my nan) have been told the doctors will not resuscitate them. They‚Äôve issue a blanket DNR.

Are there other reports of this throughout the UK? (This is in the North West). Is this a thing in other countries?

Can I just say that the way the ‚Äúno politics‚Äù rule works in practice is that someone says something inflammatory about an issue they clearly don‚Äôt understand, and then when someone posts a comment explaining why their comment is flawed automod will remove it.

Basically this rule is creating the perfect storm for a politically charged circlejerk since anyone who tries to stop it gets their comments removed

I spent some time formatting the US plan to reopen the country if anyone is interested. I feel that it is important that everyone understands what the plan entails so there is no misinformation going on.

This is a phased approach on a state-by-state basis. Before each phase can begin, there is a gating period that the state has to get through.

Below are the gating criteria that must be met before a state can begin the first or subsequent phase:

Symptoms

Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period.

AND

Downward trajectory of covid-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period

CASES

Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period

OR

Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests)

HOSPITALS

Capacity to treat all patients without crisis care

AND

Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing

If all of these criteria above are satisfied the state can begin the first or subsequent phase:

PHASE 1 - Individuals

ALL VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS should continue to shelter in place. Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home. Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents.

All individuals, WHEN IN PUBLIC (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others. Social settings of more than 10 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed.

Avoid SOCIALIZING in groups of more than 10 people in circumstances that do not readily allow for appropriate physical distancing (e.g., receptions, trade shows)

MINIMIZE NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel

PHASE 1 - Employers

Continue to ENCOURAGE TELEWORK, whenever possible and feasible with business operations.

If possible, RETURN TO WORK IN PHASES.

Close COMMON AREAS where personnel are likely to congregate and interact,or enforce strict social distancing protocols.

Minimize NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel.

Strongly consider SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS for personnel who are members of a VULNERABLE POPULATION.

PHASE 1 - Specific types of Employers

SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES (e.g., daycare, camp) that are currently closed should remain closed.

VISITS TO SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS should be prohibited. Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene.

LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under strict physical distancing protocols.

ELECTIVE SURGERIES can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines.

GYMS can open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.

BARS should remain closed.

To go to phase 2, the state must meet the original gating criteria once again after starting phase 1.

PHASE 2 - Individuals

ALL VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS should continue to shelter in place. Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home. Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents.

All individuals, WHEN IN PUBLIC (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others. Social settings of more than 50 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed.

NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL can resume.

PHASE 2 - Employers

Continue to ENCOURAGE TELEWORK, whenever possible and feasible with business operations.

Close COMMON AREAS where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, or enforce moderate social distancing protocols.

NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL can resume.Strongly consider SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS for personnel who are members of a VULNERABLE POPULATION.

PHASE 2 - Specific types of Employers

SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES (e.g., daycare, camp) can reopen.

VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS should be prohibited. Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene.

LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under moderate physical distancing protocols.

ELECTIVE SURGERIES can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient and in-patient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines.

GYMS can remain open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.

BARS may operate with diminished standing-room occupancy, where applicable and appropriate.

To go to phase 3, the state must meet the original gating criteria once again after starting phase 2.

PHASE 3 - Individuals

VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS can resume public interactions, but should practice physical distancing, minimizing exposure to social settings where distancing may not be practical, unless precautionary measures are observed.

LOW-RISK POPULATIONS should consider minimizing time spent in crowded environments.

PHASE 3 - Employers

Resume UNRESTRICTED STAFFING of worksites.

PHASE 3 - Specific types of Employers

VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS can resume. Those who interact with residents and patients must be diligent regarding hygiene.

LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under limited physical distancing protocols.

GYMS can remain open if they adhere to standard sanitation protocols.

BARS may operate with increased standing room occupancy, where applicable

There are also guidelines for all phases, which are things like continue to practice good hygiene, wipe down commonly touched surfaces, don't go to work while sick. These also include suggestions for employers such as policies regarding temperature checks, sanitation, etc.

Be on the lookout for lobbyists from other states setting up Facebook groups to convince the uneducated people in this country to defy quarantine orders! Just got invited to a group named "Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine" and thought I'd troll a bit... And whadya know?! The admins are pro-gun and anti-abortion lobbyists from Pennsylvania and Minnesota...smh...

I'm from Ohio and I've noticed a lot of people like this. Absolute craziness. I do love people being like "were taking it back ourselves!" Like right Debra I'm sure they will get right on opening up the Starbucks for you so you and Karen can go talk about Fake news and how there's too many "snowflake libs" in our society.

Apparently toxic brainless patriotism is all you need to not get coronavirus

Same in Ohio. The sad thing is that I don't have faith in many governors, even my own, to stay strong and keep stuff closed/limited. I mean the UK is talking about extending shelter orders for at least another 3 weeks. People are going to freak out over unemployment and the economy.

Idk man crazy times either way people need to take a deep breath

I am very concerned about the long term mental health implications of the disease, especially this initial lockdown. This has been brutal to my mental health, and I still get to do far more than the average person. (long story)

I know it's affecting me. And I'm a natural loner. I've been having memory issues and normally I'm sharp. I've been talking with friends and family, but the lack of routine and and in-person contact I would get is affecting me.

Yeah, my memory is also not at its best here and I have law school finals in a week lol. I tried to create a routine, but up here in Cleveland the weather has been so bipolar it's hard to set a consistent schedule for runs and walks. I'm hoping sustained good weather can help.

I never realized how important in-person contact really is. I don't know about you, but whenever a vaccine is available or it's safe to do so, I'll be out with family and friends as much as humanly possible those first couple weeks.

I took a job out of college managing a park‚Äôs social media. They put me up in a cabin in the woods by myself and left me to it. I had lots of hobbies, I went to the gym and for walks daily and got takeout a couple times a week. I was still going absolutely insane by about six weeks in. I was making the seven hour drive home to my parents house every weekend just for some human contact. Drinking almost every night, sleep schedule super messed up. And I‚Äôm very introverted and normally happy to sit at home alone. After I found another job it took me about a week to get back to feeling okay but I‚Äôm sure for some it would take much longer. I think 6-8 weeks is about the breaking point for most people and we are just about there.

Fully end? In the 2nd half of 2021, probably, when a vaccine is widely available.

The thing to look forward to is when the number of cases peaks and then falls low enough in your area that they can be contact-traced, so that normal life can resume.

Serious Question - Looking for a best guess/estimate of what percentage of the US population has been exposed to CV already. There is ~650K official cases as of today. Since we know many cases have mild or no symptoms and most people may be able to deal with symptoms at home without seeking treatment/testing.. what's a reasonable guess?

I'm thinking there is likely 10-20x the actual number of official cases. So that would put us in the 6-12 million range? That would mean 97% of the US population hasn't been exposed yet.

Anyone seen reports or posts from more official source with estimates?

Ambulance took my grandmother to ER this morning. She‚Äôll be staying there for a few days while attempting to recover from pneumonia. Covid results haven‚Äôt come in yet. Regardless of whether she has it or not, I have this horrible feeling that she will pass very soon as she is was already very weak. Hospital won‚Äôt allow visitors of course. She doesn‚Äôt speak english well, and it kills me to think that she will die alone in the hospital not knowing why nobody visited her in her final hours of life. Can anyone share their experiences with communicating with hospitalized loved ones during the pandemic?

What scenario is there other than the virus blowing up soon after the lockdowns are lifted? These lockdowns were not restrictive enough in the US to contain the spread? Only a handful of countries were/are able to test and trace and ultimately contain the virus but the US is definitely not one of those countries. Are we just going to have to come up with a daily # that we are willing to let die or become ill for the sake of our livelihood and the economy? Do we just prepare for a cycle of opening and closing shit down to mitigate each wave?

Happy thursday everyone! If you are able, please consider supporting the food bank and other like organizations. They are in desperate need as demand has increased while donations have decreased. You can donate to the organization OR your local food bank. They accept food and monetary donations however it is better to give them a monetary donation so that they have the ability to purchase what they need at likely a better price. Donate at: https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank

Coronavirus has resulted in an unprecedented need for food that the food banks are ill prepared for. In the meantime, food costs are increasing while food donations are decreasing. This pandemic is a tragedy but let us triumph in the darkness. More detailed info on the need can be found here: https://lettersontextualspaghettification.com/2020/04/13/foodbankaid/

I don't know where else to post this, I hope it's ok to post here. This is something that has been eating at me for a while now.

I'm a Chinese person from Malaysia. I haven't been to China my entire life, and personally do not like their government either.

Let me start by telling you a bit about Malaysia. It's a beautiful tropical country with 3 major races; Malays, Chinese & Indians (we have many more ethnicities, but I digress). We also have many natural resources, which is probably why the British brought my (Chinese) ancestors and Indians to my country years ago as labour. Eventually, the British left, and the Chinese and Indian labourers decided to make a home of the country they were brought to. Our independence was fraught with strife and racial tension which even caused the separation of the country into two, Malaysia & Singapore. This racial tension still persists to this day and can be seen by certain extremists who claim that Malaysian Chinese are somehow to blame for this Coronavirus.

I'm afraid now after all this settles, the world will look at all East Asian people with disdain. Like we're the ones who started this virus in the first place. I'm afraid for the safety of East Asian people everywhere, reading news of people who have been beaten or even murdered just because someone thought they were Chinese. Stories have been coming out everywhere from Europe to Africa to the States, and even Japan and Korea.

I think cases will likely be worse when it all settles.

I hope common sense prevails throughout all this, and that people recognise that even the people from China were also victims. I hope the world can move on peacefully and work together better to prevent something this unprecedented from happening again. I hope we get through this.

It's probably selfish of me to say this, but I still would love to travel (once all this settles of course) and experience the different cultures of the world. I haven't seen so much, and would love to visit. But I don't know what it's going to be like, and honestly, even looking at my own country, I'm a bit scared.

Unfortunately after significant events (take 9/11 for example) people seem out blame putting in very broad unfair strokes. 'Every' Arab national decendant did not create that problem, but many American mosques were attacked as retaliation by those who decided it was me vs them. I hope people realize how vast and beautiful and different Asian cultures are, so many unique, and not responsible for this pandemic.

Unfortunately, that is human behaviour which we can't change. Here in India, we are facing an unusual situation. Northeastern Indian have a mongoloid feature making them look like Chinese. Now people from other parts of India think that these northeastern are the reason for the spread of the disease in India when ironically NE India is the last place for this virus to spread. But then there is racial discrimination from NE people also towards mainland Indians, particularly Muslim who is accused of bringing the virus to these NE states. Funny the way human work.

Unfortunately, this is the economic impact people are scared of. Thousands who worked their butt off to build their business are going to lose everything. Even if the program had money, you can only artificially pump money into a business for so long without any underlying revenue.

Looking at the white House document on this, I'm noticing one thing. In both phases 1 and 2 it encourages vulnerable populations to continue to shelter in place. "Vulnerable" populations include, even according to the document, the obese, diabetics, and those with high blood pressure. Probably half the county or better falls under one or more of those ailments. So for all the happy talk of "hurrah hurrah restart the economy," really, half or more of the people in the country should continue to shelter in place for quite a while no matter what. I read this wording as showing you that the doctors behind the scenes are covering their bases and doing what they can/were permitted to and still raise the caution flag, despite this big baby wanting to sound like we've "won." I get a sense that this is the result of a conflicted group of doctors compromising with politicians.

It‚Äôs probably not going through the ventilation. It‚Äôs more likely that somewhat lax hygiene and preventative measures are being taken with the patients, since those in a nursing home aren‚Äôt the most active demographic to begin with.

Can someone explain the IHME model they keep touting as evidence of the projected total number of deaths having decreased? I‚Äôm in Louisiana so I‚Äôll just use the state as a reference. IHME shows Louisiana‚Äôs projected total deaths as 1,141 by August 4th. As of today, we have surpassed that number and are at 1,156. We will have a much higher number of total deaths by August 4th. So how can this model be correct and be used to project what the total number of deaths in the US will be? If one state‚Äôs numbers are incorrect, the entire model has to be incorrect. Am I missing something???

I think the issue is that the model adjusted to using the deaths and such from hospitals on a daily basis. Now we are getting backdated deaths at home, nursing homes etc. that are totally screwing with the numbers.

Here in ohio, they were nearly perfect until we started backdating deaths. Thats the answer right there.

They need to update the model to account for these deaths

Hey guys, just a heads up. Came across what is very likely a scam website. My mom requires temperature checks at her job so we looked into getting a Braun Thermoscan. There is a website called brauntherm (no S) that offers a deal for $79 with a 2 1/2 hour time limit. The official website for this thermometer seems to be brauntherms. But just watching the hoax site, it‚Äôs full of reviews and people adding items to the cart. But the site‚Äôs only been up for a month. I‚Äôm just not wanting to see anyone get ripped off trying to get something so important.

Joe Rogan has shown no symptoms and has been tested multiple times and he tests his guests before they come. And Healthcare workers and people on the front lines can't get tested.  f*** this backward country.

Coworkers girlfriend has been tested 2 days ago due to outbreak at her CNA job, this guy has been to the dentist since and keeps coming into work even though her results aren't back yet. Company knows but I'm not sure if I should be concerned or taking time off to protect myself if my company isn't going to send him home. Not sure if I am overreacting or completely reasonable to think he shouldn't be here. What would you guys do?

Idk where else to ask this, but both my parents have the virus and I have had VERY very mild symptoms for about a week now-- pretty much just loss of smell/taste and slight sore throat in the mornings. I have not left my house in 3 weeks, the only contact I've had with people is with them. Is it somehow possible that I have the virus and it's just...not affecting me? For reference, they are VERY sick with fever and coughing.

Some of the healthcare workers here where I live are being discriminated. There were instances where they are evicted from apartments/condo (as ‚Äúconcensus of the other renters‚Äù) and splashed with bleached on face. This is bad. How are your countries dealing with this (if there are any similar incidents)?

I live in Oklahoma and work at a car dealership. Life has been going on with a few ‚Äúinconveniences‚Äù as if nothing was happening in the rest of the world. I‚Äôm taking every precaution, but I‚Äôm like the only one. We had talks where we were shutting down and honestly I was getting excited to go home and spend some time with my family. It looks like we are now doubling down for profits and staying open longer hours to accommodate people who should probably be at home.

Anyways...last night I got a call from my dad that the nursing home where my grandma is at just had a COVID-19 death.

Felt like life hadn‚Äôt changed a bit until last night. Now, I‚Äôm freaking out again.

Anyone else find the new R0 data from New York extremely concerning? The R0 has been reduced to around 0.9 they say.

It's great news that it is now below 1, but with an R0 of .9 it will take 11 times longer to come down from the peak as compared to Wuhan (R0 was reduced to around 0.3).

There's no way that the city can hold out that long. So what can we do? Current measures don't seem to be effective enough, and people are already getting fed up of the current measures (see: Michigan & Nevada).

USA is in an extremely tough position.

What's up with Florida's numbers? Their stay at home order took effect on April 3... which is the same day as their peak new daily cases according to: https://fdoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d0de33f260d444c852a615dc7837c86

That doesn't make any sense and doesn't jive with what's happened everywhere else. Are they massively altering the numbers? Is the virus actually seasonal and it's warm enough there for it to be reducing cases? It just doesn't add up

Such a small amount of testing is taking place on a per-capita basis it's nearly impossible to draw any significant conclusions from the numbers. (Or you could assume a margin of error of 99% since roughly 1% of the US population has been tested thus far)

I propose a new method of hand shake. One person squirts some hand sanitizer in the palm of their hand and extends it palm up. The other person grabs their hand like they are shaking it, and once there is a sealing of the palms to prevent the sanitizer from dripping out, the hands are rotated to normal handshaking position, then the two hands massage each other until the sanitizer evaporates. ü§ù

Edit: The shake at 2:10 in this video is the closest thing I could find to what I am imagining as far as the rubbing it in massage. The one at 2:50 is pretty good too.

Declare bankruptcy. Refinance the student loan debt to the lowest interest rate available if it's not already optimized. Find the first job you can and get to work. Keep as segregated from your mother as possible. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but at the end of the day, if your mother refuses to take her own health seriously, there's nothing you can do about that. Work on acceptance. You have to do what's best for you now. You've done everything else you could. Also, don't automatically assume you're going to catch the virus.

Stop worrying about debt. Focus on loving your Mom and yourself. Apply for unemployment. Start calling local churches and ask for help. Lastly, call 1-800-273-8255 if you are scared you may hurt yourself.

You are not alone. You will never be alone. And people love you regardless of how hurt you feel. I will definitely be praying for you and your Mom.

318 known outbreaks in China were identified for this study. 317 of them occurred indoors. Only one, involving just two cases, was outdoors.

Closing beaches and parks may have been prudent in the "we don't know for sure so let's be safe" sense, but it probably wasn't necessary.

CNN keeps posting these "projections", and I get that they are projections, but it's innacurate nearly every time. They said last Sunday would be peak death toll. Then they said it would actually be Saturday. Then the last two days consecutive have had the real highest death toll to date. It's hard to take their reporting seriously. They also reduced their total death toll projection by 60K.

Is there a law that would prevent States to forcibly postpone all debt payments (extending the terms ) for the period of time of Stay At Home order? That way people could use the money for their rent/mortgage/car, etc for essentials. It will make it easier for folks to stay home without the fear of their lives completely falling apart.

The medicine is similar looking to a part of the virus. Because of this, the medicine can latch on to part of the virus (binding). When the virus is spreading in the body (replicating), the medicine takes the place of normal parts of the virus. The medicine stops replication from working right. When a virus can‚Äôt replicate, it can‚Äôt spread.

I agree, but states cannot restrict interstate travel unless you're held in suspicion of a crime and have agreed to the terms of a release pending trial. At which point, you're technically agreeing not to travel voluntarily.

You run into two issues: the dormant commerce clause and the individual fundamental right to travel which would probably qualify as a substantive due process right, and incorporated into the 14th amendment.

The DCC provides states cannot discriminate against interstate commerce, as the power to regulate interstate commerce is explicitly provided to the federal government by the constitution. While health and safety has been accepted as a reason a state may promulgate restrictions that have a chilling secondary effect on interstate commerce, it is unlikely this reasoning would be extended to an order restricting all interstate travel or interstate travel to a particular state. In other words, the states may regulate their own markets wherein products produced in other states do not meet health and safety standards of the state, but the methods and means of interstate commerce must remain in tact, including the ability for a resident to travel to another state to buy said product.

Technically, the federal government would have the best case to restrict interstate travel, as the DCC operates as a protection of federal power. But because travel is also a fundamental individual right, the law would have to pass strict scrutiny (an extremely high burden of proof), with government holding the burden to show that it has a compelling interest in restricting travel, and there are no less restrictive means to protect that interest.

Public safety is a compelling state interest, but I'm not sure the conservative court would accept that a full interstate restriction (against any particular state) was narrowly tailored.

Have a story from someone who works in a hospital. They were in direct contact with a patient who tested positive for the virus 2 days after the patient's appointment. She was told to return to work 7 days after her exposure to the individual. This is insane. If our healthcare providers aren't even following proper protocol and procedures, how on Earth are we going to get this under control? This is disturbing.

We have almost 35k deaths in the USA, we can project the actual number of confirmed cases if we have a good idea of what the actual fatality rate is. I've seen anywhere from 0.3% to 1% on some of the studies posted on r/COVID19 - this would mean we have anywhere between 3.5 million and 10 million cases in the US. Wouldn't that be good since a fairly decent sized chunk of the population is developing immunity to it?

I don't like the anti-politics auto-yeeter.

The politics policy (Rule 4) is reasonable. It bans:

shaming campaigns against businesses and individuals.

posts about a politician‚Äôs take on events will be removed unless they are actively discussing policy or legislation.

opinion pieces may be removed.

insulting people of a different ideological persuasion.

while at the same time allowing for:

Some leniency with respect to 'should'-type posts may be given for executive and legislative leadership and provincial or state authorities with large active outbreaks.

I agree with all of this. That being said, the political and economic effects of the virus are relevant right now to a lot of people's lives. If someone broke out into a rant about a certain politician in 2003 who started an illegal war, that would be irrelevant political discussion‚Äî but how we structure our economy is going to determine how many people die of this thing. Ergo, I don't think words like "soc ialism" and "kapitalism" merit automatic deletion.

A 13th person died from the Diamond Princess outbreak within the last 24 hours (not shown as red for today or yesterday). Still 7 in serious/critical condition, the same as it was yesterday, so either this death came from someone not in serious condition, or another person was also upgraded.

The first death there was on 2/20, almost two months ago. There was a small spike at the start but since then it's been extremely steady.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

It's been 6 weeks and the rate of dying does not drop. Up to 1.8% now. I know these are people with a high average age, but none of them are in nursing homes.

(You can verify it was not in the daily numbers from the 16th, which still show 12 deaths. That data does not have tracking of condition though. Time series data will also show daily deaths at the same data source.)

I read people (especially on r/collapse, I'm not a regular but I got curious) saying that there are going to be food shortages, especially for meat now. Why would that happen, though, is my question. Aren't food producers essential workers pretty much everywhere so production shouldn't be affected?

That one company claimed there would be meat shortages, but that was probably because they want a bailout.

By all accounts, most food producers are all good for now.

Hi folks, can anyone point me to a recent article that has information (guestimate) on when more tests will be made available in the US? We're planning out community engagement activities for the fall and I'm concerned we're putting time into something that is unlikely to be advisable (at best).

Thanks for your time and information.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - An attorney who is representing Pastor Tony Spell of the Life Tabernacle Church, told The Advocate newspaper Thursday he has been hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19.

Spell has made national headlines after being charged for defying Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards‚Äô stay-at-home order and holding church services in Central.

Spell‚Äôs attorney, Jeff Wittenbrink, 59, told The Advocate he attended two events at the Life Tabernacle Church earlier this month. One event was a news conference April 2 and the other event was a church service April 5.

The newspaper reports Wittenbrink has been in Baton Rouge General hospital since testing positive for the coronavirus Tuesday. Wittenbrink told the newspaper he did not feel ill during any of the events (?!) at the Life Tabernacle Church and does not know how he contracted the coronavirus.

My apologies for the long winded comment/question. I had what I though was a chest cold about a month ago. I started to feel better, then had a serious relapse the beginning of this week, with symptoms being much more severe. We had to move 2 weeks ago, and the movers did use PPE. I isolated in a separate room, but have obviously had contact with boxes and other items. I‚Äôve been staying at home, but my husband has been out to get groceries. Note he hasn‚Äôt been showing any symptoms. I don‚Äôt have a thermometer, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I had a fever, but I had severe chest congestion & difficulty breathing, as well as excessive lethargy. I was gasping for breath & felt pressure on my lungs. The last 24 hours I have been feeling significantly better. I have the option to cue for drive through testing tomorrow. Is it wise to venture out to have testing to confirm whether or not I had contracted Coronavirus? Or, since I‚Äôm feeling better should I just trending at home & leave the testing for the seriously ill?

you should get tested... it'll put you at ease. fwiw in Los Angeles where they're doing widespread testing of cold/flu symptomatic ppl, only around 10 to 12% are testing positive for COVID, meaning that the vast majority have other viral or bacterial respiratory illnesses.

Get the drive through testing. If it‚Äôs still there, you will be able to get some peace of mind knowing you‚Äôve already had it.

Hopefully it puts your mind at ease if you are positive that you can get back out there and work without worrying

What's a good way to explain to someone why you're not going to their wedding without offending them? I have some friends who plan to get married the first week in May. Even if the lockdown restrictions here are lifted by then I won't feel comfortable at a big church wedding then.

Because YouTube demonetizes your videos if you say the c-word, since it's a "sensitive event." It's meant to stop people from capitalizing on tragedies for ads, but since it's not run by human beings with human thoughts, if you even mention a "sensitive" word in your video you get nailed, even if you were just talking about why conventions were cancelled.

Serious Question for the mods here...

The Associated Press article from yesterday "China didn't warn public of likely pandemic for 6 key days" was downvoted into oblivion on this sub. AP is about as credible a source as you could ask for, the article is detailed and well sourced, and the content is extremely relevant to the Coronavirus discussion.

Today it's still in top 30 of r-slash-news subreddit and it's being discussed and widely reported on in almost every major news outlet (Washington Post, Politico, Forbes, NY Post, Fox Business, CBC, LA times, CNN all carrying articles on it). But yet somehow surprisingly the story remains buried here, I see one CNN article that talks about it ~40 posts down... A quick read through shows both posts full of low effort generally anti-American and pro-CCP comments... (I'm guessing reply's to this post will probably be similar in nature). What I'm saying is, at some point, doesn't the brigading by 50 cent Army or whoever become so obvious that you feel you should take some action?

For example, how about pinning a post to the top if it's clearly a relevant and credible source that's being widely reported and talked about across the world, but at the same time is obviously being brigaded by bad actors on this sub? You don't have to do this in all cases but even doing it a couple times would probably significantly dissuade the brigading.

Personally, I think it's wild that states are already talking about lifting shelter in place orders when they've just now shown slight improvement. I get people are getting antsy and there's people who think the virus wasn't even worth all this commotion but regardless, 2 weeks ago we were worried of this stuff spreading like G-Virus and now everyone seems to be over it just so they can "have their freedoms back." I think if people are allowed to go back to normal May 1st, this thing could come back with a vengeance. Especially since testing is not universal and PPE isn't readily available right now.

But what do I know? Nothing lol

I think the talk of reopening is happening bc I think it‚Äôs like 22 million ppl r unemployed. If we were to keep lockdown through the summer it would be catastrophic. I think Governor Cuomo is handling talk of reopening well. He said that in order to begin reopening, we need extremely wide scale testing (swans and antibody). He also showed a chart thingy that said the first businesses to open will be the most essential and the least risk of spread, continue through the chart until the last businesses to open are the least essential and highest risk.

I totally see that. Unemployment has been an absolute cluster f***, even for myself. I think if it was working better and people had money yeah it'd be better. I'm just worried of business/money getting in the way of science and more importantly the protection of those employees. I mean even my work has pretty strict procedures in place for when we can go back to work next week but you really think businesses are going to send someone home with a slight cough Everytime it happens? Or how long is the temperature readings going to happen till someone's too busy and they just don't do it ya know

Yeah ur right if we don‚Äôt do this exactly right then we could do this al over again but way worse bc instead of 1,000 people infected and spreading it it‚Äôs probably an insane number of asymptomatic cases yk. I‚Äôm in highschool but I have a summer job I want to go back to. I know it‚Äôs probably super first world to say but it‚Äôs annoying that I get like a year of highschool taken from me and this summer we prob won‚Äôt have parties or anything. I‚Äôm just lucky my parents still have their jobs and that money isn‚Äôt a problem. If it sucks for me I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like for people in way worse situations. Good luck man I hope u come out of this shit fine lol.

But after seeing that NY will be required to start wearing masks, knowing a large portion of people won‚Äôt have access to one, how can I get them to people? I see a lot of people online selling these masks for ridiculous prices, so I want to give mine away, possibly with an optional donation for supplies. How do I get this going?

Would it be entirely ridiculous for me to wear my Honeywell 5500 series half mask out? I could just wear a bandanna, but I have this for when I paint vehicle parts. I'm assuming it would block the virus entirely and be extremely safe. But how ridiculous would it be?

Also, No, I cannot donate it as I have worn it dozens of times and sweated into it and everything.

We talk about it a lot, but there's not a lot to say. It hasn't been a disease in enough humans for a proper study longer than about three months. Two months outside China, where transparency is a thing. Long term effects are unknown.

You look at 2 million global confirmed cases and think "whoah, we ought to know a lot about this by now." But March 1st there were only 88,000 cases in the world, almost all of them in China. 6 weeks is normally about the right amount of time to write a proposal to apply for a grant to undertake a study.

I like to play in excel so I've been charting cases and deaths using this source that is updated every few minutes throughout the day:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

I've been projecting near future expectations on numbers based purely on mathematical forecasting. Initially things were looking very doomsday like as cases and death rates were following exponential growth curves. I was a little freaked out because you could easily see 1M deaths in the US by May but a few weeks ago the total numbers started moving back down towards more linear increases. Shit's bad but not apocalyptic. We're still likely to hit 100,000 deaths bay May or June in the US but its only that low because of stay at home orders and social distancing.

I'm getting afraid that people are growing impatient and numbers will start to curve back up to exponential growth due to this "blow back" reaction, particularly among conservative groups.

There has been a huge corrective jump in deaths in the last few days. I hope that's just a correction from under-reporting and not an indication of a real increase.

EDIT: I just saw that starting April 14th the CDC has changed its definition and now counts covid deaths if they haven't been confirmed by a laboratory, so basically if you have the symptoms and die in the hospital then it counts. (I'm sure I over simplified it)

I'm the same. I saw the exponential rate on 3-10 said " f***, this is the real deal."

You're right though, it is linear but not stopping.

I feel like it is an inevitable plague that we are delaying and that the economic and mental health consequences are very soon going to be worse than the virus.

So how can we go about getting PPE for say a relative who is a doctor and is treating infants with Coronovirus but without a n95 mask because the hospital is low on PPE?

Sorry if this has been talked but is there any news on why France is showing +17,164 new cases today? Is that a mistake, statistical anomaly, change in data reporting, or just a really bad day for them? I searched the sub and google but I couldn't find anything.

I have been very curious about whether Americans wear masks or not since 50 days ago. twenty-four days ago, Americans of this subreddit said they couldn't get it because they didn't have enough masks in stock. They also said we don't wear masks because for the medical staff. What I want to ask you now is this. Don't Americans still wear masks?

Why is the rate and way of infection so strange, like in my city a symptomatic woman went to work, a big meeting and was home with family and no one got infected but here people say walking outside can get you infected if you pass through someone's viral cloud like what's the truth?

For my healthcare work, I was given a 3M N95 mask to use as needed. I have a large head/face so this regular N95 does not seal completely. I see though that there is only "small" and "regular". What do people do that need a larger size? Different brand?

115 of the sickest patients got it, all but 2 recovered, and recovery was much faster.

May not be a cure, and a tiny sample, but it‚Äôs something that may give doctors something concrete to use to fight back against this disease.

At worst, it‚Äôs something to try

Yes NY changed their dataset to include the cases where covid was the probable cause but no confirming test. But for reasons I do not understand, it looks like they dumped all the numbers in one day instead of adding them to the previous days when they actually died. They did warn ahead of time that they were planning to do this but it is still super confusing.

I think it's more frustration as many times the "good news" is overblown and it's interpreted as people downplaying it. It took months to make people take this seriously and there's a fear that people are looking for any excuse to fuel their confirmation bias to justify trying to go back to normal life. Like governors saying "looks like we flattened the curve, time to open things back up." This is a longer slog and people rushing it because they are tired of sitting around is not the best thing.

Great way to put it. I agree we can't rush back and I actually wish we (the U.S.) shut everything down much before we eventually did, but that's neither here nor there. I was just looking at a post where Australia was really flattening the curve and there was a comment to the effect of "yeah and then once one infected person enters the country we start this whole process over again. Boom"

It's been very interesting watching how close family/friends react to this. Some will make a conspiracy about every aspect of it, from the origin to the death count. Then there are those who said "it's just the flu" back in February and won't change their mind despite all of the contrary evidence.

I‚Äôm concerned about a couple friends of mine who each live alone. They‚Äôve both talked about this being hard for them mentally, but whenever I try to talk them about cool things we can do in the summer when SIP is hopefully over, they just get super negative and say we‚Äôre gonna be stuck inside all summer. I think one of them has already decided he‚Äôs gonna stay home until there‚Äôs a vaccine, and he‚Äôs definitely not in a high risk category. I get that they want to be safe and not contribute to the spread of the virus, but it just feels like they‚Äôre tanking their mental health to do so.

This sort of situation is tough on everyone, even introverts who like being home like myself. While I can offer no real helpful advice for your friends I can say there are free online places where they can get counseling if they need someone to talk or vent to.

I don‚Äôt think anyone who plans to quarantine themselves until a vaccine will actually follow through. The mental health consequences of that would be an absolute disaster, they‚Äôll deteriorate far more than they ever thought possible. You might just have to wait on them to realize they can‚Äôt do it.

I live alone and only have work/family members as social contacts, so I am feeling this too. It's a relief to have a short phone call with a good friend every so often. I feel so relieved, like my chest is tight for days and then just loosens up as I just talk and be myself.

So keep being there for your friend, you don't necessarily need to make this situation "better" for them with promises of future fun. Instead, be with them in this moment, no matter how crappy the circumstances, and then they'll feel the relief of having your undivided attention and love.

Sometimes we need a little heaven right here right now, and that heaven is being near a good friend for most of us. If not physically, emotionally near

Am I the only one that wonders about all these commercials and ad campaigns? Really quickly, every industry had new commercials out with actors and new footage. Both radio and tv. So even though it's suppose to be only essential business and social distancing, there's a lot of folks still working together in studios and on site.

There are also numerous horrific stories like this all across the country. Old folks homes and veterans homes are being devastated, and not all deaths are being accounted for.

And this Facilities and companies are still hiding numbers. As a country, we are outright refusing to see the problem, our heads are still collectively buried in the sand, except for a few good positions of leadership.

Conspiracy theorists are spewing that the death count is being inflated. Bull- f***ing-shit. I'd be shocked if it wasnt truly at least 10% low.

My wife has 99.8 temperature, headache, cough and fatigue. We planned for this sort of thing. She's isolated in 1 room of the house, away from me and the kids. I know this has a high recovery rate, and she isn't high risk. Still, it's something.

The thing is she hasn't left the house in a month, aside from walks. Ive done all the shopping. So maybe that means I'm asymptomatic and gave it to her?

Can anyone tell me why the CDC and WHO, when talking about hot baths, flat out lie and say that hot water can‚Äôt change internal body temperature and that water hot enough to do so will burn you?

Anyone with a hot tub or basic knowledge of how the body regulates temperature knows that‚Äôs a flat out lie, and who the  f*** is going to be taking baths in scalding water? This is a flat out lie.

Not only that, but research has been done and proven that artificially inducing an artificial Hyperthermia has been shown to boost certain immune response. (Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6083/ see section‚ÄùEffects of Induced Thermal Elevation (Hyperthermia) on Immunity‚Äù)

Other than chemical induction of hyperthermia, the other way to induce artificial hyperthermia is submersion in water at around 107¬∞-109¬∞F for monitored sessions.

It is a dangerous to be exposed to that heat for a prolonged amount of time without monitoring your internal temperature closely, but that could have been the warning instead of saying that hot baths don‚Äôt change your body temperature at all. Which can potentially have the opposite effect and lead people to taking baths that actually are too hot.

Like I‚Äôm the furthest from a conspiracy theorist, but this stuck out for me like a sore thumb because I actually researched this and did a report on this topic in college.

It would be one thing if they said ‚ÄúIt is unlikely that hot baths will improve or worsen the COVID-19 condition,‚Äù but to flat out lie and say that your body temperature won‚Äôt change and that it does nothing?

It frustrates me, because this right here is why people aren‚Äôt trusting these organizations.

I'd expect restrictions to be lifted progressively over late May and early June. Something akin to what Switzerland announced today:

April 27th: Small person to person services (hair dresser, floral shops, therapeutic massages etc);

May 11th: Mandatory school re-openings;

June 8th: Additional re-openings (restaurants/bars etc)

Only I would expect US timelines to be 3-4 weeks behind this.

I am 42 years old, married, and have two young kids who are five, and almost 3. I think the same thing a you on an almost hourly basis. The time we are living in right now is very surreal. Sometimes when I am endlessly reading articles on my phone, I think ‚Äúif this weren‚Äôt happening, what would I be doing right now at this moment in time? What else would I be reading? What else would I be doing?‚Äú

I‚Äôm a mentally strong person but this can all get to be too much. I have to remind myself daily that this isn‚Äôt forever, and try my best to avoid all the doom-laden conspiracy stuff out there.

My safety and health and that of my family is paramount to anything else and it‚Äôs all I can control.

It‚Äôs pretty scary but I like to think about once we get a vaccine or treatment or whatever we can all appreciate the little things so much more and hanging out with friends and stuff will be so much more fun. And we can tell our kids a cool story when we grow up. I‚Äôm a high schooler so I get what ur going thru. It sucks but life will be so fun after this is all over and they r talking abt reopening some stuff this summer. Don‚Äôt pay attention to the super negative comments in this thread. No one actually knows that much about this virus and it‚Äôs defiantly not the Redditors that know the most lol.

My college is already talking about possibly delaying the fall semester to November at the latest so that we have in person classes. They want to everything to avoid having a remote semester and will only do so if there is no other option.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt think starting in November is a wise choice, if another wave of cases happens in the fall I think it is best to just do the semester remotely.

This article on Sweden is outstanding. https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/can-you-beat-covid-19-without-a-lockdown-sweden-is-trying

So Sweden is staying the course. If you wanted to frame things in a zero-sum manner, you could say that either Sweden makes a fool of itself, or it makes a fool of everyone else. But zero-sum thinking isn‚Äôt appropriate in this case, because everyone is hoping for the same results in the end. If Sweden can make its looser approach work, avoiding mass death while allowing people to live their lives, then the rest of us can make it work too, and we‚Äôll be happier for it. Will it work? History is rife with cases of calamity brought about by expertise in violation of common sense. If that‚Äôs what happens in Sweden, we‚Äôll be grateful for the warning. But experts at their best point the way to common sense, even when no one else can see it. If that‚Äôs what happens in Sweden, we‚Äôll be grateful for the example.

Just watched today's whitehouse Corona Virus briefing where the various phases and requirements for each phase was outlined.

As a layman, they seem reasonable to me... Wherever possible, open up gradually....so just curious what the general feeling was here on this?

If you work at a bar, restaurant or movie theater or own one..your near future in that business is not looking good. Phase 3 is not going to happen till a vaccine again for most states.. ..it‚Äôs a hope Phase..most states will bounce like a ping pong ball between 1 and 2..same may even have to go back to gating or even further...

I think Fauci nailed it when he said this will be a back and forth for many states...trump was being as optimistic as he could. But even Mark Cuban said the writing is on the wall for sports with fans filling the stadiums for the rest of this year.

Remember we were suppose to have therapeutics for the summer in place by now..still nothing...and no real one size fits all yet on that one..

They seem reasonable if they actually follow them. For instance they said business should do temp checks in phase 1. The business that are open aren't  f***ing doing that now so I struggle to us following them.

Are we doing the best we can with these social distance lines waiting to get into the super market for example? I can picture someone who is expelling Covid in line. He/she stands in one place for 5 to 10 minutes spewing a concentrated load of virus. The line then moves. Someone else ends up parked in that exact same position for another 5 to 10 minutes when the line stops. It is almost like swabbing a Petrie dish except you don‚Äôt swipe you dab stopping at several spots putting a big load some places. Big stores should start using apps or other technology to let people know when it is their turn to go in. Get rid of these lines. When I see them I drive elsewhere. Any thoughts or science on this?

Amongst all the bickering, conspiracy theories, and doomers spreading fear, I wanted to share a positive (what??????!) story that might inspire others.

While I'm generally not too concerned about getting sick (I'm healthy, and pretty fit), I have noticed in the last year that my blood pressure had been rising a bit. I was getting readings of 130/80-90. This concerned me a lot. I guess about 6 weeks ago I decided that I wasn't ok with this at all and made some heart healthy changes to get it back down. I:

Stopped drinking alcohol during the week.

Started exercising every day (we have a Peloton bike and I do 30-45 minutes daily)

Reduced sodium in the food that I'm making.

Added raspberries, blueberries and strawberries to my cereal (cheerios) in the morning.

Eat mixed nuts, or pistachios as a snack between breakfast and lunch.

Eat a banana every afternoon for a snack.

Eat sunflower seeds/pumpkin seeds as a snack after dinner.

After 6 weeks, my blood pressure is now 110-114/60-70. Obviously I intend to keep up the routine, as I want to be at my best incase I do get sick, but I'm sharing this because I know how daunting it can be to improve yourself, and I bet a lot of people say "there's not much I can do now..." type things to themselves.

It's never too late to start being more healthy, whether that's quitting smoking, quitting/reducing alcohol, reducing sodium or eating healthy to lose weight. Stay safe, stay healthy, everyone!

There are countless voices making vague, abstract calls to "open the country back up," but what's interesting is there are barely any (if any at all) individual voices begging to go back to their underpaid, unsafe jobs. Those people want financial relief, not the opportunity to work until they die.

So the ones who want the opening and the ones who would actually facilitate the opening appear to be two completely different sets of people.

It really depends. For example, I'd expect the US and Canada to lift restrictions in summer, for example. But I would expect non-essential intercontinental travel to remain iffy until at least Fall, if not the rest of the year.

Hundreds of opponents of Michigan‚Äôs social distancing measures rallied in their cars in the state capital on Wednesday, snarling traffic and even blocking a hospital entrance in a protest against an executive order intended to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus in the state.

‚ÄúThe cars were blocking one of our hospitals, so an ambulance literally wasn‚Äôt able to get into the bay for ten minutes,‚Äù said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose statewide stay-at-home order provoked the ire of many right-wingers and Trump supporters. The order banned residents from traveling to second homes, closed non-essential businesses, and limited outdoor activities in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.

‚ÄúThis is the kind of behavior that extends the needs for stay-at-home orders,‚Äù Whitmer said in a television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe worst thing that could have happened today.‚Äù

Question: Felt as home-made mask filter material?

The homemade mask instructions I've seen all say "tight-woven cotton, so that you can't see through it"...but anything I've found either I can see through it or I can't breathe through it. I'm currently using a bandana as the outer layer for my mask, and found that some felt I have, even in a double layer, is much easier to breathe through while not being see-through even in a single layer. Is cotton bandana + 2 layers of felt likely to be effective? Should I stick to layers of cotton?

My pool cleaner who only comes once a month notified me that his mother has tested positive. He does not live with her but she has had it for a month before they tested her in Alabama. The pool cleaner is still working. I have no plans to use the pool for another month. Is this a problem for me or should I tell him not to come? I have been putting mail and non perishable groceries in the sun for a day or so to take advantage of UV that may kill the virus on packages. Given that the pool is in the sun will this be ok for me? I live alone. Sorry for the first world problem but I don't want to fire the pool guy.

You're good, chlorine is basically bleach and virus wouldn't last very long outside.

Mail - you can open all your mail, but when you are done (and before touching your face) just wash your hands. If you want to be 100% safe clean the surface you put the mail on while handling.

We use the island in kitchen for groceries, shopping, mail, amazon packages. Just wipe down/wash hands when done.

What if the curve is flattened, but case numbers do not decrease? With this quarantine going on for a month, and the disease presenting symptoms in 14 days, I‚Äôd think we would be seeing a bigger drop in new infections. What if the current numbers are the normal amount of infections while living under this state of lockdown?

Hopefully they are modeling the rate of spread during a shelter in place to get a better idea of what restrictions they can loosen.

The lightest form of social distancing and contact tracing even has an effect on the spread of the virus. People have to figure out that happy part that keeps society going with out burning it down.

Some states have released people early, but other states are refusing. My state said it wouldnt be a benefit to release early. They said we send inmates out during a pandemic without money, a job, housing, or healthcare and they would struggle hard. At the correctional facility they are housed, fed, and have their own medical staff. Take that for what‚Äôs its worth.

The big headline yesterday was a Florida man that was released and then murdered someone the next day.

They‚Äôve been releasing people in Canada. Basically accelerating the parole process. There are a number of prisons with outbreaks.

Edit: completely wrong. There are still requests being made to release, but corrections Canada is saying it's not warranted.

What is happening, is that judges are releasing many people who'd normally remain in custody awaiting trial.

A couple tips for allergy sufferers...

I have seasonal allergies and I have to decide if I've caught something or if I'm just having an allergy attack and need a pill. This year has been extra stress filled because of that.

Not anymore.

Now, *I run my recirculating fan for my AC plus a plug in floor HEPA fan. With that combination, the allergy symptoms for everyone in the house have almost vanished. Now, we don't have to constantly worry that our allergy symptoms might mean we've caught COVID or some other infection.

(Yes, washing hands, got a seasonal flu shot months ago, and acting as if I'm an asymptomatic carrier while wearing a mask in public.)

Nobody knows. Why would you get tested if you never had symptoms? I‚Äôve heard speculation that up to 25% could go asymptomatic, but I‚Äôve never heard anyone with a background in epidemiology say 50%.

Face mask, any type ( bandana will do if you don‚Äôt have anything else). Take a small personal hand sanitizer if you have one. Gloves are optional, I don‚Äôt use them, instead I use the sanitiser. Go and do your shop, observe the social distancing mesures as best you can.

Enjoy being outside, make the most of leaving the house/ look fore the positives.

When you get home take ur cloths off and leve them by the front door ( I put the same close on to go out every day so I don‚Äôt wash them but you can wash them if it helps you feel safer) and go for a shower. I usually wipe the door handle and my phone down when I come in.

This is my daily practice. I personally think it‚Äôs a bit ott but my partner insist on the taking cloths off and the shower, so I do it to help her feel more secure.

Hope that helps

I've been noticing more grocery stores having a list of requirements posted outside their store. Some even have lines formed outside and limit the number of people allowed at any given time.

But the basics you should follow are wearing a mask, use gloves if you're high risk, and practice social distancing if possible. If you notice the grocery store is packed, try going back at a different time you think it might not be as busy.

Absolutely a mask. Gloves aren't necessary, just wash your hands before and after. I personally cover my eyes as well, they can be a potential vector of contamination - I use sunglasses because it's better than nothing.

Ideally, you will also sanitize most of your groceries when you get home (dry goods that you won't touch for a few days should be fine, but anything going into the fridge or freezer, and anything you're planning on touching in the next day or two, should be sanitized as a precaution. Hop in the shower and change your clothes.

Are you referring to the deaths? They include nursing home deaths so due to a lag in reporting those numbers some days there's a sudden increase in the number of deaths

Can someone explain the data spike to over 6000 per day shown on the number of cases here?

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

Sounds like they retroactively added all the deaths of probable cause from covid to that one day? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Is anyone familiar with these kn95 masks

Are they safe / effective? I work as a plumber in homes and construction sites and have been reusing/rotating the three n95‚Äôs that i have by sanitizing them in the oven (per the Stanford medicine study)

They‚Äôre getting trashed , I‚Äôd love to hear people‚Äôs opinions on these particular masks as they look pretty well designed

the filtering ability of the fabric in KN95 is basically identical to N95, except regulated/tested by the Chinese government, not the US NIOSH.

That said, there are other aspects of mask quality besides the fabric, namely fit and how well it seals against the face.

There are hundreds of different factories in China producing KN95 masks, and occasionally fake KN95 masks. They are marketed under a ton of different names. There isn't really a giant brand like 3M I'd just trust out of the gate. You have to do your own due diligence on the particular masks

Kn95 are the China equivalent to N95. They offer the same 95% effectiveness. A little more air resistance, but a tiny bit more leakage.

Those masks in particular I don‚Äôt know. They are ‚Äúcertified‚Äù though.

SO is losing unemployment benefits from second job because the first job got the money to keep their small business open. He is making less now than when he worked at both jobs and less than when he was able to claim unemployment for both jobs.

On one hand his boss is getting free money to keep her bar open to keep paying employees but only pays him what he got paid from that one job, and on the other she can‚Äôt get the money unless he is off unemployment entirely. He is taking a significant pay cut for someone who had to have two jobs in the first place. If he tells her no, he would lose his unemployment for refusing hours anyway.....what are his options here? Seems like this ‚Äúfor the good of the employee‚Äù grant she is getting is only for her own good in this situation.

might do. I mean even though manufacturers aren't currently making cars alot of dealers probably have a huge backlog of cars that they weren't able to sell due to this sudden lockdown. So they may be inclined to get rid of the old stock. And then with the economy in a right state car sales will obviously be way down since most won't be looking for new cars after this. Dealers may start pushing out better deals to try and boost sales. Think it's fair to say that you could probably end upgetting some really good car deals

It's anyones guess but it's highly likely they've been manipulating it's numbers. They just came out now and revised it's death toll by an extra 1,290 making it now 4,632 because apparently they missed a few deaths from a while ago

According to official data from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the number of Covid-19 dead rose by 299 to 3,868 on Friday. That was the second-highest number of daily fatalities so far, but lower than the 315 dead reported on Thursday. Also, they reported 3,380 new coronavirus cases, an uptick compared to previous days that took the total number of infections to 133,830 since the crisis started.

The amount they can financially help us has limits. Even the US government can't patch up this amount of economic damage indefinitely. We can't just keep doing $2 trillion relief bills. We risk changing the texture of life in America, in ways none of us want.

Say it with me:

Sweden's strategy is working.

Sweden's strategy is working.

Sweden's strategy is working.

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-rates-easing-despite-loose-rule/

Dr. Tegnell said he believes certain regions in Sweden are already very close to achieving ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù ‚Äî a state where so many in the population have built up resistance to the virus that it is no longer a pandemic threat.

‚ÄúWe do believe the main difference between our policies and many other countries‚Äô policies is that we could easily keep these kinds of policies in place for months, maybe even years, without any real damage to society or our economy,‚Äù Dr. Tegnell said.

Ask yourself: why so much shit for Sweden and Switzerland -- already planning to re-open -- gets a pass? Is this about Sweden's strategy not working or is it about other countries refusing to acknowledge Sweden's success?

Switzerland (8.6 million people): 26,732 cases; 1,281 deaths

Sweden (10.5 million people): 12,540 cases; 1,333 deaths

You don't have to wait a month. Those numbers are already bad. For comparison, South Korea has 5 times the population (51.64 million) and 1/4 the deaths (229). Germany has 8 times the population (83.02 million) and only 4 times the deaths (3,943). Sweden's death rates are on par with the USA which has 33 times the population (328.2 million) and 34 times the deaths (34,475).

If you want to look to a country to imitate it should based on the real numbers.

I think the danger here is that comparing Sweden (and Switzerland) to other countries is apples and oranges. If you were to compare Sweden to Italy for instance, Italy has about 4 times the population density, 6 times to overall population, has an older population overall, and has a much higher incidence of multi-generational households where younger "virus spreaders" are living together with "at risk" older adults. The lax approach may work in Sweden, but in Italy it would be a disaster.

I'd also believe the herd immunity in certain regions claim when I see the numbers from large scale testing - that is have the majority of people actually been infected? If not, there's still a LONG way to go. I feel like pointing to Sweden's success is a bit premature especially if you're saying we should use it to shape policy elsewhere.

Okay, but you ignore Japan, which has a higher rate of intergenerational living than Italy, has not locked anything down for months (and far less voluntary social distancing than Sweden), and has only had 178 deaths in a country of 127 million people.

I would say we should closely watch what happens in Japan and hopefully learn something from it. We don't know that they aren't about to get slammed. If they don't, then perhaps there is something the Japanese are doing that we should know about (they are known for their excellent hygiene and lack of handshaking for instance). But it's also possible that they are just late to the party. I'm just saying that drawing conclusions from the data has to be done rigorously. Until we have two identical countries to compare where the epidemic starts off identically on the same timeline, but then diverges due to differing policies, I think it's hard if not impossible to know for sure what policies are best. We do know that in some places (like NYC) the medical system can absolutely not handle any more patients, so allowing folks to spread the virus unchecked in those areas would be a no go.

We don't know that they aren't about to get slammed.

Wouldn't they have already been "slammed" as during the past four months as a coronavirus raged an hour's flight away from their country and they practiced almost no social distancing? I doubt they will be "slammed" anytime soon, especially now that China has the situation under control.

We do know that in some places (like NYC) the medical system can absolutely not handle any more patients, so allowing folks to spread the virus unchecked in those areas would be a no go.

Really? The hospital ship is empty, the convention center hospital empty, many hospitals are close to empty.

well we've seen in other countries that the death rate did slow down with a lockdown in place like in Spain where it finally seems to have gone down significantly. But i still say its too early to judge whether Sweden has taken the right approach. Anything can change in a month.

I‚Äôm from New York so our states r doing a joined kind of reopening. Based on Cuomo‚Äôs briefing yesterday, I think the earliest some businesses will open is late May. We need extremely wide scale testing, and we need help from the federal gov, but trump and Cuomo started arguing and Cuomo should have been careful what he wished for bc he wanted trump to step out of states reopening so trump said like ok fine do it urself. I wish we would go about this with our leaders not bickering and fighting but ig that‚Äôs impossible lol.

A lot of people are saying we need to stay shut down until a vaccine is found. If there are currently no vaccines for SARS OR MERS, how do they anticipate making a Covid-19 vaccine? Is it realistic that a vaccine will be found for Covid-19 if one has not been found for SARS or MERS?

No. My optimistic side says since it is a world problem more people are working on finding a vaccine. This will probably take 2 years. Alternatively, researchers have been working on a coronavirus vaccine for over 40 years with no luck. Best we can hope for is to slow the transmission so people can get the care they need in hospitals.

There were some close-ish for SARS, but those were following the standard length procedure for vaccines because SARS was pretty contained and is hasn't had a new case in over a decade.

SARS is very similar to COVID structurally. Because scientists have spent a decade working on that virus that is so similar, their prior work may help

It's really unknown at this point, since there isn't a currently approved for human use coronavirus vaccine to base estimates on.

But... there is a lot of money being poured into finding one and vaccine creation techniques have advanced a lot since the days of SARS.

I really question the data we get. Total deaths seem to not count tons of people. I also wonder whether we do, or should, count people who die not directly from coronavirus but indirectly because they cannot get medical care because all the ICU staff is occupied with coronavirus patients. Do we have data on TOTAL DEATHS per country, compared to, say, a year ago? That would be a much better indicator of the overall impact. And wouldn't depend on any testing at all, just death counts.

If you have paper towel, you can take a couple of sheets and make a quick disposable mask. The only other things you need is a stapler and a couple of rubber bands (or hair tie). Super simple youtube tutorial here. I'd probably double up on the paper towel for additional protection.

You can wash a shirt mask in any sort of soap, dry it in the air and use it again. Using it as a facemask doesn't make it disposable.

May be a dumb question. Can I boil it instead? I forgot that I have one in the van tied in a plastic bag. I don't want to do a full load of laundry this late (I have to pay for my laundry)

Actually yeah, same concept. High temp washes are usually 160 degrees so you don't even need to boil it. You don't necessarily need soap but it helps a LOT.

This is what happens when a president calls something a hoax and no one takes it seriously. Interesting how South Koreas actions drop it's position compares to western nations. You can't tell me that the US doesn't have spies in China, and didn't know what was happening in China in Feb. No spies? I don't believe it.

My wife works at a daycare that's planning on opening back up on May 4th. She has lupus and is considered high risk. If it comes down to it and has to quit (we're hoping the owner works with her but she hasn't been very responsive over the past few weeks), will she still be able to collect unemployment, including the extra $600 or is she SOL?

Where are people getting masks (in the U.S.)? The last time I was out, about half of the people I saw were wearing masks, and none of them looked homemade. Now my area is making masks mandatory for everybody. I really don't want to try and make my own, but I may not have a choice.

I can wait a few weeks for delivery, but not a month. Amazon has a special page for non-medical COVID-19 masks, but a lot of them are obvious inappropriate (I saw one with a nose hole,) so I don't trust their recommendations. I don't know what to order.

If you are not working with covid patients you have no reason to get a high grade mask just use any face cover and social distance 4 meters. Wear glasses and wash your hands.

When will it be fine to go to someone's house? Like if you could get there without using public transit, when will it be okay just to go and see a loved one at their house?

Obviously no one can give a "correct" answer, but hopefully someone can give a good estimate... I'm starting to feel the weight of not being able to see those I care about and the thought of not knowing when I will is even worse.

Criticizing the WHO doesn't mean we should entirely cut funding for it. It's two different things.

It's the same thing with the travel ban from China -- this was probably a good idea. The problem was that Trump was treating this as a complete solution to a situation he still wasn't taking seriously.

I never chimed in regarding WHO, but by all accounts they  f***ed up early on trying to downplay the severity. Disappointing and only worsened things. But I can also see how an imperfect WHO is better than none at all.

Imagine you have a 30 mile commute to work and one day your car breaks down. It sucks, but do you throw the whole car away and start walking every day after that? Or do you patch it up and keep driving it to work until you can upgrade?

Not the greatest analogy but the first that came to mind.

Trump is trying to discredit them saying they didn't actually warn the US, since he  f***ed everything up so bad (they did, and so did many intelligence reports). They may not be great but this is the reason he's pulling support. He only does things to help himself.

Everyone on here was criticizing WHO for being shady and backing up China all the time, now that Trump doesn't support WHO it suddenly isn't a shady organization anymore and Trump is in the wrong?

I swear Reddit is just contrarian for the sake of being anti-Trump lol

Criticizing the WHO is certainly legitimate. Cutting funding off during a global pandemic as Trump is doing is incredibly  f***ing stupid, not to mention Congress already allocated the money for it and he's overstepping his authority. He's also trying to shift the blame for his own incompetence in the American response.

Not too difficult to understand, is it?

That must be the United States? I'm seeing the exact opposite in Canada, lots of unification, neighbours helping neighbours even if they're a town over.

Even the places I interact with at work are just chugging along. Sure there's some gripes, you definitely don't want to be a snowbird going to a grocery store in your RV. People still bitching about politics, store lineups, and the lack of restaurant choices.

Realistically when they say old people stay home, they are referring to the elderly. Thing is, many of them are already staying home, they are stuck in retirement facilities and dying off in droves because the staff that works there, and visitors, bring in the virus and it spreads like crazy.

People need to understand that if we decide to go back to normal, we are effectively killing off the elderly. This is already happening WITH the lockdown. These are the people that built today's society and shaped it's culture. It's a genocide of an entire population. Maybe some people are OK living with this blood on their hands. I have a tough time though.

Cuomo extended the shutdown to May 15th. Do you guys think he will extend it further? In my opinion I don‚Äôt think he can. At some point we need to reopen bc people will starve to death, and I think the public will start to riot, especially since grocery stores are starting to dwindle.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll extend it past August. A lot of countries tried to open to early and were hurt by that. That‚Äôs why Cuomo is expressing we MUST listen to science/data.

My guess is that towards the end of May, we will start to slowly open.

Just got back from walking my dog and one of my neighbors was having a tailgate party in their front yard of around 15-20 people. It looks like most of the groups were six feet apart (couples/families) but they were near the sidewalk so as I passed I was like 2-4 feet from some people.

I was pretty furious seeing them all out drinking - like really? You couldn‚Äôt wait a month or two to have a party again, even if you‚Äôre social distancing? Am I an asshole for giving them a dirty look and calling them idiots under my breath? Now that I‚Äôm home and have cooled off a bit I feel kinda bad.

today pretty much confirms that this sub is wholly negative and just upvotes clickbaity 'OUR LEADERSHIP SUCKS' and 'WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE' posts.

Today they leaked information that shows U. Chicago medical's remdesivir trial is performing well in severely ill patients. A huge breakthrough as it's the first therapeutic to show effectiveness in severe cases.

No mention of that on this page. But there are a dozen posts where every comment has some wild speculation on how this will get even worse with gem comments like 'the virus will mutate to kill children too' being upvoted.

Retired research nurse here (public health, cancer). Herd immunity to a novel virus is a natural consequence of this type of disease as it spreads throughout our global community.

The goal is to prevent massive numbers of illnesses and deaths occurring within a very short time period. This would overwhelm medical systems , economic systems, political systems even more than what we are currently experiencing. So your gut feeling is correct.

Personally, during the height of flu season, I would like to see us all wearing masks in stores, schools etc. and enforcing stay at home when sick rules. I would also like to see better education regarding vaccines to prevent people from succumbing to misinformation.

What do you think?

Here is a nice synopsis from Johns Hopkins: What is Herd Immunity

As a gross over-simplification, we can use swine flu as an example since we did very little from a societal standpoint. There were probably around 60 million cases in the U.S. With COVID-19, that would mean roughly 2 million deaths with a mortality of 3%.

Again, not an accurate scientific model given the different R0 values, different herd immunity requirements, different transmissibility, etc. But it gives an idea of how many people a pandemic can reach without intervention.

I've seen that the hashtag #CoronaWillEndSoon is trending in the U.S. As someone with family that falls into the at-risk-group as well as two parents who've worked within the medical industry for 20+ years, this kind of mindset is truly INFURIATING.

I don't understand why some people seem to believe that once May rolls around, all of this is just going to make like the MCU in "Infinity War" and * b l o w a w a y *. There are people and businesses and groups still actively going out of their way to defy government-mandated LOCKDOWNS in addition to more socially encouraged distancing from one another. Diseases don't take vacations or weekends off, folks! This thing is here and judging by the constant flow of new data and updates to the current situation, it is likely something that we will be dealing with for quite some time.

I'm sure the overwhelming majority of us here are hopefully treating this situation with the delicacy and severity it deserves. But, if for some reason, you think that we're "close to the end" or others are overreacting, you need to take a good hard look at yourself. YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM. I'm not saying we need to maintain a state of constant panic and paranoia, but the idea that such irresponsible statements such as "This will end soon" are gaining NATIONAL traction is incredibly concerning to me. I apologize that this is more of a rant than anything, but seeing this hashtag trending in any kind of capacity is disgusting to me

There seems to be a subset of the population that thinks that once lockdown is over, it will just magically disappear. The lockdown was never meant to stop it completely but to stop the hospital systems from being overloaded. I do worry about how things will be when the country opens up...if some Americans are not disciplined enough to respect social distancing and lockdowns, imagine when the restrictions lesson...

honestly it just goes to show how idiotic humans can be and just how selfish we are. Some seem to think the lockdown is meant to make the virus go away. I remember my aunt telling me oh after a few weeks it'll be over because otherwise why have a lockdown. Like no the whole point of a lockdown is to buy us time that hospitals dont become overwhelmed where we can't treat every covid19 patient and where we can't even treat non covid19 patients. It's simply to slow the rate of infection which should in turn mean fewer people dying from this. This virus is going to stay with us for a while and probably until a vaccine is found. Several European countries are only doing partial lifting of its lockdowns rather then fully reopening all at once in order to avoid a second wave of new cases. It's delusional to think coronavirus will be gone anytime soon.

Also unfortunately some people will refuse to take this virus seriously until it's too late and one of their loved ones is in hospital with coronavirus. I already know two people one of my dads employees and another guy that i used to work with that have unfortunately lost their lives to coronavirus. I saw a post on Facebook the other day from someone I know about that their healthy and in a low risk group so why should they have to stay at home when they'll be fine if they caught it. Like how selfish do you have to be to think like that when you're still at risk of infecting others

Can someone tell me what they're waiting for to open things back up? A vaccine won't be coming any time soon, are they just waiting for hospitals to get better supplied or what? I just feel we should almost be getting some healthy people sick so we can get some sort of herd immunity going. It just feels like theres no long term goals with the leadership going on.

Slow the spread enough to where experts can contain, not just mitigate. They can contain by doing testing, isolation, and contact tracing.

I think in a more organized, pandemic-prepared society, healthy people would go up work still, unhealthy/vulnerable people would be told to self quarantine and be given UBI.

No society on Earth protects the whole population from sickness, the young healthy ones should go out and be properly compensated for the risk. The unhealthy should stay home and be compensated for the inconveniences.

Most likely waiting for the pressure on ICUs to drop before lifting restrictions bit by bit. We're going towards herd immunity either way, the restrictions are just to slow it down so we can treat the ones that need it without hospital capacity running out

There are long term goals for actual leaders in this country (governors of California, Washington, Oregon, New York, etc.)...just not the president.

https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/04/14/newsom-lays-out-plan-to-slowly-reopen-economy.html

The six indicators are:

The ability to monitor through testing, contact tracing, isolating and supporting those who are positive or exposed. 

The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19. 

The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges. 

The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand. 

The ability for businesses, schools and child care facilities to support physical distancing.

The ability to determine when to reinstitute measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.

Cuomo said today NY (I don‚Äôt remember if state or city) had an R0 = 1.2 before social distancing/lockdown and now has an R0 = 0.9.

There is no chance they are opening up before June with that number. There‚Äôs no chance. He also said he expects their number of confirmed cases to rise or fall not with the number of cases, but with their ability to do the testing. So when they run a lot of tests through the system, they confirm more cases. When they run fewer, the percentage positive remains the same and they just get fewer confirmed cases. That means there is a DEEP pool of people positive while not sick enough to justify a test. God only knows if they‚Äôre sick enough to stay home, but for a lot of them probably not. They will infect others, many of whom will not get terribly sick, and some will get very sick or die.

I think we‚Äôre  f***ed.

I don‚Äôt agree with that. At some point our democracy is going to have to decide if those tens of millions of unemployed are more valuable than the tens of thousands who are going to die of this thing. And the best way for citizens in a democracy to make that decision is to be informed with accurate data. I can‚Äôt believe we still don‚Äôt have that.

Right! But 0.9 means every infected person infects on average 0.9 others. BUT they aren‚Äôt counting all the infected people. In fact, they are counting the sickest infected people because they still don‚Äôt have enough tests. It is possible the sickest people are most likely to transmit the disease during each chance encounter, but they probably have fewer chance encounters because they are sick. So the healthy people might actually be transmitting more even though they‚Äôre infected.

Serious question: instead of the USA government sending $1200... why didn‚Äôt they set up a plan to send everyone a hazmat suit, a year supply of medical gloves and masks? People won‚Äôt use their $1200 to buy that stuff unfortunately but probably would use masks laying around their house that were given to them.

Are you  f***ing kidding me? Each week when I go to the food bank the line gets longer and longer and they have less to give out. I've gone a few days in a row several times the last few weeks not eating because I literally didn't have the money to buy food and still don't. If it wasn't for what I got this Monday from the food bank and from the generosity someone displayed last night to me, I most likely wouldn't be eating Saturday night and all of Sunday, and have to pray Monday they don't start turning us away from the food bank.

I'm about to be 2 months behind on rent on top of all that and the only thing that's keeping a roof over my head is that my city suspended evictions until May 15th. That $1200 is ALL going towards food and trying to make some deal with my landlord with the rest, otherwise a tent in the park is looking like a reality for me.

But yeah, a hazmat suit would definitely be useful in this situation. The damage to the economy has been done by the slow response to this pandemic, even if we all got to wear hazmat suits right now and go out and about, a lot of jobs aren't coming back, including mine.

In response to the comment u/whattaUwant so conveniently deleted. Here's proof of their deleted comment: https://imgur.com/t1l31KV

u/whattaUwant:

It sounds like you have terrible money management skills. Maybe you‚Äôll learn from this and create an emergency savings fund in the future. Maybe stop living above your means.. such as you could start by getting rid of your internet.



My response:

I don't even know where to start with the amount of ignorance you're displaying.



I'm using an Xfinity WiFi Hotspot, you know the ones they made for free at the beginning of lockdowns. I haven't had an internet bill in the last 3 years. All my meals are cooked, I never go out. I drink tap water to save on my grocery bill.



But yeah, please go ahead and judge me because you know my life. People like you are a big problem of what's wrong in this world, and the sad part is your type just double down. Go ahead, keep trying to put me down, whatever makes you feel better.

In today‚Äôs press conference Governer Dewine of Ohio is basically contradicting everything he‚Äôs said over the past month by saying we need to get the economy back and going. People are OD‚Äôing etc from being home and it‚Äôs important to get things going. I think he‚Äôs caving to societal pressure. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll end well. Honestly, with this approach, there was zero point in closing down in the first place. Not enough people have got the virus in Ohio yet and if everyone returns to work, covid will return in full force and likely overwhelm the hospital system. The 2nd wave will make the first wave look like nothing.

My wife is an obstetrician here in India who says we need to wait till June- July period till the first babies who were conceived happened in the month of December in China to definitively say if this virus will cause a birth defect. More than the present scenario of people getting sick and dying, I believe if this is true it would be the most destructive factor of the virus. Virus-like Rubella and more recently Zika virus infection prenatally is known to cause a birth defect.

Serious question: I live in a ground level apartment in a mid-sized Northeastern US city. By law, our landlord is required to keep the heat on until June, and the apartment is so old that we have no valve to adjust the heat settings with. The apartment is also on a major street with lots of foot traffic, even the past few weeks. If I open my windows am I risking getting covid? Heat is up to 80 most days so It‚Äôs hard to do anything. Is opening windows increasing my risk??

If I'm not mistaken, I just read recently that if you filed taxes, you'll receive a check, or direct deposit. There is an FAQ section on the IRS website that can answer your questions. I was looking for something different, but I seem to remember reading something that applies to younger workers. Check into it, and good luck. You deserve it as much as anyone else.

Every indication thus far suggests it is mutating slowly. However, we are seeing different DNA markers in New York and the west coast. The NIH is working with groups who are developing vaccines that mimic portions of the Spike protein that have shown little capacity for rapid mutation.

Yes, it mutates, just like all reproducing things mutate. If you want to see the different strains, see this website. https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=clade_membership

I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but it's been explained to me that environmental pressures will drive a virus to increase it's infection rate; which makes sense since a higher infection rate virus will out compete its less infectious strains. So that usually means the virus mutates to become less dangerous because that helps it spread more.

What the mutation can also do is defeat vaccination - but others have discussed that coronaviruses don't mutate very fast and it's unknown at what type of frequency that would happen.

Don‚Äôt worry too much. As the serious cases go down, states start testing more mild, non hospitalized, or even asymptomatic cases.

The case count likely IS dropping, but now we are testing the types of cases we were NEVER testing before

Warmer weather, this is a virus, viruses thrive in the cold not in the warmth. Also density is a big one, if New York was eliminated from this we would have only about 60% of the cases we have now.

Just to ease my paranoia. I just recently got my diabetic medicine delivered , so we know if it can stay on medicine like how it stays on hard surfaces for a few hours or so.

My paranoia is bothering me because what if the person who made my medicine and put it in my bottle had it

Pharmacists are medical professionals. They take good care to not work sick, wear PPE and have sterile conditions while compounding medicine. Messing up your meds would cost them a multimillion dollar business. It's fine.

This is your paranoia talking and not your reason. If it's insulin, a person likely hasn't touched the actual vials or pens. If pills, if it's the manufacturers bottle, it has a seal and probably wasn't created in the past few hours. If the pharmacy actually counted out -- all the ones I've seen, the workers are wearing masks and gloves.

Take your meds.

MA friends- what timeframe are you predicting for local life ‚Äúopening‚Äù again? I know we are in the coalition with states such as NY, which is a good idea, IMO.

I am hoping by June the local playgrounds, beaches, etc will start to open. I obviously don‚Äôt expect bars, stadiums, concerts or anything like that to be open as usual.

I‚Äôm also anxious about child care. I‚Äôm hoping we get more clarity on that soon.

I‚Äôm curious as to everyone‚Äôs opinions on those videos of people making face masks out of socks. How effective do you think they are? Would you say they are ‚Äúbetter than nothing‚Äù?

I‚Äôm concerned they may be in the ‚Äúmore potentially harmful then potentially good‚Äù category.

Socks are single ply loose knits with loose holes that can stretch wide. They are also moisture wicking and made to be absorbent. They don‚Äôt pass the lighter test (I tried). A lot of the articles and research I see about cloth masks in particular says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use knits‚Äù. Which makes sense because they don‚Äôt seem capable of filtering much. But I also worry about absorbency. Socks are more absorbant than most woven fabrics, right? They‚Äôre advertised to be. When a sock mask is moistened by aerosols in the air, wouldn‚Äôt it be more likely to wick away that moisture, and make the wearer constantly exposed? What do you think?

I guess I‚Äôm just concerned about people thinking they‚Äôre safe because they put a cut up sock over their mouths.

Edited to add: I forgot to mention, I did the lighter test with a sock mask. you try to blow out a lighter in front of your face to see how much of your air goes through. With the sock the lighter was blown right out. With a homemade cloth mask with shop towel filter I couldn‚Äôt blow it I‚Äôm out, not could I with a surgical mask or n95

I saw a paper online that discussed various fabrics and their ability to filter particles the size of microns (like viruses) and it seems like well-made handmade ones out of regular fabric offer about 20% protectiveness. I don‚Äôt imagine anything knit with holes or gaps to do anything at all.

I don‚Äôt totally understand why people think it‚Äôs enough to cover the face without thinking about the type of material...

Non N95 masks won't really make us "safe". But it could filter out some of the big stuff, like a spray. Maybe it will lessen the intensity, or at least serve as a reminder to distance. It can reduce the intensity of others receiving our virus and bacteria.

This may be outdated so look up official sources. We are making make shift masks right now to protect others not ourselves. When everyone wears a mask this indirectly protects ourselves. The reason being make shift masks stifle the trajectory of potential virus particles from spewing out of our mouths but does not do a great job of keeping them out. Medical grade masks like N95 do a good job at both but these are for medical professionals only at the moment as there is a shortage and we need them better protected than the general public since they are our front line defense.

Okay, if everybody wore masks (source control) for 20 days in the usa, kept distance and no one comes into our country..... where would the virus go? Wouldn't it die and be no more with no host?

In theory, yes. But it doesn't work like that in the real world. Masks aren't perfect. Used properly, maybe they reduce the chance of transmission by 99%. But with ~1 million infected in the U.S., that's still ten thousand potential new infections if everyone interacts with just 1 other person during those 20 days. And plenty of people would violate the quarantine and wear their masks improperly or inconsistently.

And you can't fully shut down everything. The definition of "essential" most states are using is quite broad, but even the truly essential services (power, water, police, fire, EMS) still means people will be interacting at some level.

The idea is to combine social distancing and stay-at-home practices enough to knock the virus down to levels that are manageable, where cases, exposures, and outbreaks can be contained individually by contact tracing and quarantining of specific cases. Hopefully this can be done at a level that doesn't restrict living life too much, taking precautions like limiting gathering sizes and continuing mask use. Then we settle in for the long, boring, cautious haul until a vaccine is available.

It's probably the best solution. Close the borders, ban air travel in and out of the country, make masks mandatory in public, and continue social distancing and the washing of the hands.

Since this virus attacks/destroys your T cells, conditions that cause lymphocytopenia would be the main risk factors for fatal complications. Of course as you age, your lymphocyte count goes down as well.

Lymphocytopenia, but not idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia, is associated with corticosteroid use, infections with HIV and other viral, bacterial, and fungal agents, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus,[3] severe stress,[4] intense or prolonged physical exercise (due to cortisol release),[5] rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis,[6] multiple sclerosis,[7] and iatrogenic (caused by other medical treatments) conditions.

These people actually make some sense to me. Online we live in a bubble where everyone lives in big cities or the nearby suburbs, and is connected to the news. Imagine living in rural/exurban areas, hearing about how they're shutting everything down, and not knowing a single person with COVID19, and then having a big WTF moment when you get told to stay home from work for a virus you have zero exposure to.

Humans dont really have an intuitive capacity to understand things that happen outside of their closest 150 people or so. I work in healthcare and have seen/taken care of hundreds of COVID patients and literally do not even know a soul in real life or on facebook with a positive test.

Issue with looking at hospitalizations is that they are not hospitalizing people until they are in life threatening situations. News last night highlighted a man that went to emergency room three times before he was admitted. He was immediately put on ventilator the fourth time. My neighbor had the same experience. Fortunately, both survived.

It seems here, Colorado US, that they are making more beds available by setting up field hospitals but not admitting people. One way to flatten the curve I guess...

Read an article about shoes being able to carry the virus. My thoughts are can this be used to our advantage at the entrances of shops especially supermarkets by putting something down at the entrance for people to step on. At the end of the day you take samples of it and you could see if the virus is present at that store instead of waiting for people to get sick first.

The USA represents over 25% of all coronavirus activity*, yet the USA only makes up 4.3% of the world population.

If you take the total world deaths (137,060), 4.3% is about 5,826. The USA death total is 28,640. So it would appear to me that Trump got 22,814 additional Americans killed through ineffectual leadership.

No.

Antibiotics attack specific sites on bacteria, like a key in a lock. If a version spreads that doesn't have that lock, we're in trouble. Alcohol physically disassembles the entire envelope of this virus. There's not just one weak spot that can be eliminated.

Proper handwashing and disinfectants are very effective. It's not like antibiotics. No virus is going to evolve an immunity to bleach or soap. I suppose there's an argument to be made that we're disrupting our skin's micriobiome and removing potentially beneficial bacteria.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely at the rate this thing mutates, which is (so far) fairly slow.

Even if a more deadly version of this virus were to emerge, it would be to the disadvantage of the virus because it would be more likely to render its hosts unable to go anywhere for being so weak and sick and we would probably be more likely to panic quarantine it really hardcore. No letting anyone roam the streets. If it were to start killing people at a higher rate I think we would have no choice but to choke it off at all costs.

Viruses need as many hosts as possible, so most of the time viruses mutate in ways that make them easier to spread and less likely to kill their hosts.

Just wanted to get the word out that I'm making/shipping 100% cloth masks for $5 each if anyone is in need. You are entitled to 2 free cloth masks if you can provide proof of donating PPE (such as N95 masks or surgical masks) to an organization in need.

EDIT: I should clarify. I'm not promoting these masks to make a profit. If you have the time, materials, and ability to make your own masks, I am not suggesting that you purchase one from me (though you're welcome to if you want) - there are a million wonderful tutorials online (here's one by the CDC). I am offering these masks for people who are not in that position and cannot make their own masks, not because I'm trying make a quick buck.

A few reasons:

I would rather encourage people to donate whatever PPE they have on hand to local hospitals; if getting a $5 mask makes them feel safe enough to give up their surgical masks, I think that's a greater net benefit than donating cloth masks to the hospital directly (though the people who are doing that are doing a wonderful job and I applaud them!)

My local hospitals aren't currently accepting hand made masks, and even if they were, I'm not totally sure I'm confident enough in my sewing skills to offer up masks that would be used by professional medical personnel (though as soon as the option opens up I'll be looking into it)

There's a surprising amount of people who either don't know how to sew or don't have the materials on hand to make a mask. I want people to have a cheap option for face masks if they need it. I figured $5 was pretty affordable (as opposed to some of the $7 - $12+ options I'm seeing on Etsy and the like)

Also, speaking of Etsy; while I have no way of promising that my masks are the highest quality cloth masks out there, I at least know that I'm doing research to try and make masks that are as effective as possible for a cloth option; I don't know for sure, but some of the masks I see for sale on Etsy and other websites look like they might be sacrificing quality for appearance; using polyester fabrics because they have cuter pattern designs, etc.

EDIT: Holy shit, thank you so much for the gold, although if anyone else reads this and has similar cash to spend, I'd encourage you to donate to a charity in need; I've personally donated to the COVID19 Solidarity Reponse Fund.

Where is a good place to ask someone with a background in the field, and knowledge of the subject the following question:

The "quick" serology tests that have been developed and some of which that have been approved in the United States by the FDA EUA, from my understanding only tell you if the virus is in your blood, which can take X number of days from the time you are infected. What variables make up that X number of days it takes until it gets into your blood? Would an a-symptomatic person who is carrying the virus test positive with a serological test?

For all intents and purposes the numbers coming out of China are pretty much meaningless. No one knows real numbers because no one is being told real numbers.

No, and I wouldn't even bother looking. The CCP is so clearly lying about their numbers that it's not worth wasting your time until some NGO does a count.

If I had to guess, their total case number is probably lower than their total death number, but that's just a guess

So even when businesses start to reopen, you would assume there‚Äôs going to be new guidelines and bans on large crowds. Is it safe to say that amusement parks will be closed until there‚Äôs a vaccine available?

I don‚Äôt see how the large amusement parks return anytime soon. Disney parks have over 100,000 a day at their parks. They‚Äôre operating at a loss with the crowd numbers that are deemed safe within the next year

They were when they were paying employees, but they‚Äôve furloughed 77,000 of them and keeping around 500 on and paid and that‚Äôs just what they need to maintain the parks.

If they‚Äôre only allowed to have 50 people or maybe 500 people as guests mac each day it‚Äôll cost more to pay employees to operate the rides, be costumed characters, operate the rides, etc. than to be closed.

The problem is they still need to pay their bills. They still have to pay real estate loans, utilities, insurance, etc. I don‚Äôt seem them getting a massive bailout to cover these hard costs.

I‚Äôm in a non-hotspot rural part of Florida and I am really worried/anxious - and I am also confused to if I should be? I have a couple diagnosed disorders (including anxiety ha) and this is whole situation is driving me crazy.

I see hardly anyone using masks. Everyone is pissed that everything isn‚Äôt open. People aren‚Äôt social distancing.

Because of my culture I live with older family members. I‚Äôve been on eggshells about giving it to them since the reddit posts about Wuhan. I quit my job and don‚Äôt leave but to use drive-thrus.

What is the correct response?

People who say it‚Äôs not worse than the flu? Okay but they are having to use refrigerator semi‚Äôs to store bodies that isn‚Äôt normal flu. People say we don‚Äôt have to worry because we in a rural area? Some lady Supposedly died after not leaving her house for three weeks/how does it it get to fairly rural nursing homes?

And then the news says that Florida is doing way better than people thought. I thought spring break would basically devastate the state because I knew the government wouldn‚Äôt shut it down before then. Is t because of our warmer weather or are we just not reporting? The majority of prisons in the state are located in the panhandle which is barely (relatively) impacted.

I feel like a conspiracy theorist for being scared when our numbers are doing better than they thought or are we just not reporting?

Partially not testing enough, partially the climate, partially infected people with no symptoms. As for the nursing home question, it would be staff or family people who bring it into the nursing home.

Numbers seem better because the models are getting better and the measures work. 2 million is not realistic any more. And yes for now it's worse then the flu... Do you see refrigerator trucks parked next to hospitals durin flu season?? Don't believe the Facebook hypes. Yes rural areas have an advantage, less densely packed with people so less chance. Unless you go to some dumb 2k people megachurch... Keep doing what you are doing to keep with the guidelines. :)

I just listened to the governor in NY, he stated that they are not tracking the infection rate only the hospitalizations. He said in order to know the infection rate they would have to roll out more testing. Does he mean in NY all the positives are people who have been hospitalized? That seems like a crazy number.

No lol thank god there isn‚Äôt 212k hospitalizations lol. I think he may mean starting now? Idk tbh it kinda makes sense bc how many cases are reported a day is more or less based on how many tests are conducted for now, so hospitalizations give us a better look at how bad the situation is, and when we will be able to contain the virus and treat everyone, while also reopening businesses.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone have any idea what's going to happen in north Florida? Our stay at home order is set to expire at the end of the month, so when it ends should we keep up with social distancing to some degree? I have a feeling there won't be any restrictions after this one is over.

I would say given the situation on testing and how late DeSantis was in shutting things down, even partially, it would be wise for any Florida resident to practice social distancing and wear a mask whenever you leave the house for some time.

I‚Äôm wondering how many people are willing to join public events after the virus clears up? I routinely went to Sports Venus and concerts in the Bay Area (California) but I am worried about being in large gatherings of people. How bad will this hit our economy if we have empty arenas?

If you're a season ticket holder for some big league team, I guess I can kind of understand being disappointed, but I have to imagine there's some way people are being compensated. If people really think they have a right to whine and moan about their favorite artist postponing or cancelling shows/tours, they should try speaking with smaller acts right now.

While music is more of a hobby for me, I have friends whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ability to do local shows or small state-to-state tour legs. Yes, it's part of being in the biz, especially if you don't have a large following. That doesn't take away from the fact that many gig musicians are in a very uncertain place right now. It really stinks to see your friends struggling, and then seeing average people and even celebs like Vanessa Hudgens bitching about Coachella being cancelled/postponed/whatever. We're living in a time where a lot of people are showing just how out of wack their priorities are and it's just.. gross :/

Changes in United States Data following the new CDC guidelines on "Case" and "Death" definition

Following new CDC guidelines: "As of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an interim COVID-19 position statement issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease.

A confirmed case or death is defined by meeting confirmatory laboratory evidence for COVID-19. A probable case or death is defined by i) meeting clinical criteria AND epidemiologic evidence with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19; or ii) meeting presumptive laboratory evidence AND either clinical criteria OR epidemiologic evidence; or iii) meeting vital records criteria with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID19" [source]

This change is a further example of one of the many reasons why the label "confirmed cases" (used by some to designate total cases) is incorrect (see definitions for more details). The US CDC (and Worldometer) has always used the label "Total Cases." Canada is another example where the "total number includes publicly reported confirmed and probable cases [source]

On April 14, New York City reported 3,778 additional deaths that have occurred since March 11 and have been classified as "probable," defined as follows: ‚Äúdecedent [...] had no known positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) but the death certificate lists as a cause of death ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù or an equivalent" [source]. 

From April 14 onward, New York City has provided - and will continue to provide -  the updated number of probable deaths in its daily reports.

On April 15, in the daily press briefing, New York Governor Cuomo said that "we will begin reporting all categories of fatalities pursuant to new CDC guidelines and are contacting facilities to get updated numbers." He also added that there may be additional people who died that have not been counted because not in a hospital. In the April 15 update, the New York State Department of Health official website had still not included (nor reported separately) the additional "probable" deaths reported by New York City the day before. On April 16, when asked about the issue, New York State officials commented on their decision to not add the New York City probable deaths in the official State count saying that probable deaths have been reported by New York City in a new and separate category, without adding the two numbers (confirmed and probable) together into a single category.

The state of Ohio is an example of a state that has started reporting total cases and deaths correctly, in accordance with the new CDC guidelines. On its "Overview dashboard" it show total cases and total deaths, while also providing the breakdown between confirmed and probable, with the note "CDC Expanded Case Definition (Probable)" and "CDC Expanded Death Definition (Probable)."

Worldometer is also correctly following the new CDC guideline of including both probable and confirmed in the total case and death counts.

As with similar instances in the past (with other countries), we have added the additional data on the day it was reported. If and when the historical distribution is provided, we will make the needed adjustments.

Finally, since every probable death necessarily implies a probable case, logic mandates that the adjustment be made to both deaths and cases, and not only to deaths. We have now adjusted April 14, April 15, and current data for New York State and the United States accordingly.

The flu shot does not kill people. The flu does, especially those who did not get the vaccine.

A small percentage of people have adverse reactions to the flu vaccine that can include death. It's just an acceptable risk.

Edit: Just to clarify and to scare people less, it's like less than 1 in a million. Do you feel that lucky?

"I‚Äôve heard that now they are careful when leaking those results since maybe people go buy all the drugs from the pharmacy in a rush and leave ppl that really need it without it"

All these drugs are prescription drugs at least in the U.S. so that's not true.

Well I‚Äôm not talking about US only. Idk if this happens in the US but in my country prescription drugs can be obtained easily by other ways or false prescriptions

And also referring to things that contain the drug, like that man who died for taking cloroquina for the fish cleaning thing

Confirmed cases is kind of a crap shoot. They decrease test processing and it looks like a slowdown.

New US deaths yesterday were by far the highest yet recorded, but the average daily % increase from the day before has come down. To the extent that it takes longer for deaths per day to double can be seen as a sort of improvement. But that's a hard thing to be happy about. Less deaths per day would be a better goal.

Easily could be. Cases will remain high until we get through the backlog of now mild and asymptotic cases.

I think there is a strong chance that things are declining and improving, but numbers will remain high as they keep counting the backlog of mild and asymptomatic cases

Does anyone know of ANY place online that is selling disinfectant wipes?

I work at a hospital and have been wiping down my stuff and surfaces regularly. I also didn't hoard any wipes or anything bc I'm not a shitty person. Now I'm starting to run low. I've got about 2 things of 35 wipes each left.

I can't find anything online where wipes are available and every local store I've checked out has been completely sold out.

Alcohol sanitizer actually works better/faster than wipes (wipes are mostly peroxide), it take alcohol 30 seconds to kill viruses, and take peroxide wipes 1 min, also if your wiped surface dried before the 1 min is up then you did not kill everything. At my hospital I wipe all surfaces with alcohol even before we ran low on wipes.

Someone made a suggestion awhile ago to try stores that might not be known for carrying general products but they do anyways (for them a local hardware store had toilet paper etc) so they might have some disinfectant products as well. Also I know Amazon is sending disinfectant products priority to hospitals and first responders so if you were able to email them proof of the fact you‚Äôre a hospital employee then they might be able to send something. Hopefully this helped!

My brother is being forced to work at a factory that may be contaminated.

A worker in the factory my brother works at just got confirmed to have covid-19, now beforehand the company said if the guy did have it they would shut down the factory for 2 weeks and give hazard pay. However now that he has been confirmed to have it they are making us still work at the factory, they are going to give hazard pay but it is absolute bullshit. Is this illegal, the guy that had it works in the same building as my older brother, yet they are making him risk dying for his money.

So the IRS "Get My Payment" website won't accept a negative value or zero as an adjusted gross income. Last year my AGI was -$13,243, yes negative thirteen thousand. This is extremely frustrating and now I'm locked out of the system again for another 24 hours. And of course the IRS says everywhere not to call them, so I can't even let them know of this major bug. Now just have to hope they eventually realize this screw-up and fix it.

Those are people who died at home before testing results came in and are presumed to have died due to coronavirus. IIRC 200 people in NYC are dying at home every day while the pre pandemic average was 20 people per day. Edit: source https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-deaths.html

Is there any correlation between the severity of symptoms at onset and eventual severity of the disease? I've been experiencing covid-like symptoms, but very mild ones, for 3 days now. I know the disease tends to come on slow, but at what point do you generally know if you're going to have a severe case?

It stalls at about 5-7 days after first symptoms then at about day 10 it intensifies, if you don't have to be admitted to the hospital by this point you are most likely in the clear.

There‚Äôs a massive difference between confirmed case mortality rate and actual mortality rate in the midst of any epidemic/pandemic. Countries that have been overwhelmed (from a healthcare standpoint) have little reason to concern themselves with epidemiological data right now; the concern is focused on treating the sick.

From an public health standpoint, overall confirmed cases is almost irrelevant until large-scale testing is available. The key markers for epidemiologists are:

number of new cases per day

% of new cases requiring hospitalization

% of hospitalizations requiring ICU/intubation

It‚Äôs a strange way to look at the pandemic, but from a macro view (which is what public health people must have), death toll is simply a numerator; we will have no real idea of the mortality rate until we have an accurate denominator. That will not happen for a while.

MPH epidemiologist

No country or organization has any clear idea of the total cases, therefore there is absolutely no way of determining mortality rate of the virus; anybody saying they know is at best guessing, or at worst, lying.

The health care system has been shattered by politicians for many years, and the leaders of the country are currently incompetent populists.

The UK is only about 30th in the list of the richest countries in the world (GDP PPP per head), and if you don't count the super-rich central London, it's probably more like 35th, and the trend is more towards 40th.

It was an accident and the CCP is trying to cover it up so their incompetent isn't on full display. A recent graduate student accidentally got infected when she was researching it. They all probably underestimated how contagious the virus is, and remember it can take 2 weeks for symptoms to show. So during the time she was asymptomatic she infected the rest of the lab. Of course they all have lives in Wuhan and went home to their families, some even to the Huanan Seafood Market 300 feet away from the Wuhan CDC this research was taking place. This close proximity makes it really easy for the CCP to pin it on the wet market.

It's a believable story and there's strong evidence that points towards there being more fact than fiction to this. Here's a pretty good video that links all the sources they use in the video description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpQFCcSI0pU



FYI I'm the last person to buy into a conspiracy theory, but after looking at all the sources myself, it's really hard to dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory.

I made the mistake of unmuting the tv, did trump just say states can start reopening?! Did I hear that right seriously?

Edit: Downvoted for what? MAGA fans must be out in force today.

Just found out someone in my 200+ unit condo tested positive for the virus. So that‚Äôs fun.

They won‚Äôt say who obviously, or what floor they live on.

All I know is there are 3/4‚Äù gaps under all the apartment doors which, I was told by the building manager last year, can‚Äôt be sealed. She said it would have an effect on the ‚Äúflow of air through the building‚Äù. I had asked about putting a strip at the bottom of the door to cut down on hallway noise.

So this sick person is exhaling virus into their apartment, and the virus is free to travel out into the hallway. Hopefully the carpet mitigates it. But I have no idea how the HVAC system circulates air.

I‚Äôm sorry. You sound so stressed about this. but if the person is inside of their unit, it is extremely unlikely that the virus would travel from them inside their apartment, through a crack, and back up into the air where you (or anyone else) could inhale it. I don‚Äôt want to say it is impossible, but technically it is very close to that.

How long does it last on skin? I went out shopping and as I was going to take off my mask I accidentally touched my cheeks. I washed my face like 3 times after that, tho. Is it fair to say I killed the virus with the washing?

Yes I do leave my non-perishables untouched for days in their bags. Never thought about my actual clothes or skin/hair though. Apr 4th was the last time I was in a grocery store. I've been getting groceries delivered since and plan to for as long as I can find delivery slots but if/when I do need to venture out again, I will do the same. Thanks.

Realistically? No one knows. Orange County, FL is including the parks as part of their re-opening committee. Shanghai Disney has soft opened. Some resorts are open, their equivalent to Disney Springs is open, and some restaurants are open. The theme park is not open yet. If I were betting money, I‚Äôd say Disney World will do the same. Disneyland might be another story. Disney World will probably open some resorts, shops, and restaurants long before the parks. They‚Äôre also going to have to decide what measures the parks will take. Will they switch to virtual queues? Will they be checking temperatures? Will they limit admission to resort guests and AP holders? No one knows right now.

Here‚Äôs what we do know: Disney ended a bunch of employment programs including the college program. That‚Äôs a large portion of their workforce. They also opened casting calls for August for international casting programs. We also know that the bare minimum cast is working right now- mostly security. They‚Äôre going to need to bring people in to get ready for any kind of opening. They‚Äôre currently only accepting reservations starting in June. When you see some of that happening, then you can assume Disney has a date in the reasonably near future.

In Florida news, Florida‚Äôs positive testing percentage has been steadily decreasing. Also, DeSantis loves Trump so he‚Äôll be quick to jump on the reopening plan, which would be six weeks minimum to open the parks once you start the first phase.

Overall, if I had to guess? As long as Florida continues to decline in severity, probably some time September through November.

Stay at home should continue at minimum until we can actually buy toilet paper and paper towels. Trump should solve that supply chain, then we can move on to testing. Once those bare minimum steps are figured out then we can move forward.

One reason toilet paper is so hard to find is because everyone is staying home. A ton of the supply is tied up on the retail side of distribution which is not being used thanks to nobody using public restrooms. We‚Äôre still using the same amount every day but now we effectively only have half of what we used to.

Interesting, our shops seem to be stocked as normal we had some issues in the beginning with people panic buying but not an issue now. I‚Äôm uk/ Ireland

I can confirm our paper towels, which I assume is what we call kitchen roll lol is also okay.

Not at all related but of all the things we say differently the one thing I really find entertaining is Americans calling bread rolls biscuits and calling biscuits cookies lol for YEARS I thought you were all eating cookies with your soup.

that seems like something that could be easily fixed, if the supply chains would pause orders to retail, small businesses would appreciate the savings. If only there was one federal type of president that could set that up. Maybe one day. One day soon, #calexit #nationstate

i'm fine with the Donald taking the lead from governors who obviously have shown more expertise and leadership during this pandemic crisis than he. I'm just perplexed and demoralized that he hasn't put more money into Testing! We're so behind the curve with testing symptomatic ppl that we can't even begin to test asymptomatic front-line workers. At this stage we should be testing every single health care professional serving nursing homes and assisted living facilities. But it seems we just encounter bottle-neck after bottle-neck.

Nearly every country is struggling with testing because the test kits are exactly that, kits. The kit is designed to use the components contained within it. If there's a major shortage of swabs, you can't just substitute a swab from a different kit. If there's a shortage of a reagent, you can't just substitute it with a similar reagent from a different kit. https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comments-about-reagents-needed-for-covid-19-swab-pcr-testing/

Yeah but imagine the shock. You just spent 16 years preparing to be what you want to grow up to be. Diligently applied yourself to your lessons. Honed your skills. Maybe did some internships in your desired field. Boomtime economy looks like it's going to roll on forever at historic low unemployment. Employers are headhunting you.

And then a few weeks before graduation, the world changed. Boom. Now you're one of 22 millions out of work, lacking experience, and if the job you wanted still exists you're going to have to find a way to stand out in a crowd of thousands. The good paying jobs are going to go to someone's cousin.

Computer scientist. Unfortunately I was about 12 years early. Reagan was president, PCs were still very uncommon.

I did eventually summit that mountain and enjoyed the view for as long as I cared to before moving on. But the climb was brutal. For a long time it was not certain I would survive it.

I'm going to be fine. I'm going into this looking at early retirement. I have compassion for these young people just now launching their lives not because I am in their shoes, but because I was. And many friends didn't make it, falling by chance, or luck, or lack of foresight, or despair.

Graduated a couple years back, and started working a real, career-progressing job in 2019. Worked there for not quite 6 months before getting laid off, along with most of the company. Just when my fiancee and I were paying off our debt in earnest, building up savings, finding new investments, and I finally, for the first time in years, had good insurance with dental and vision and decently low deductibles. Absolutely maddening. I'm cautiously hopeful that this will motivate more people to push back against the norms of unsustainable 80 hour work weeks, insurance tied to employment, and unlivable wages in the US.

I would use homemade, well fitting masks for working, and I would use the KN95s for high risk stuff like going to the store or public transport.

Do you think this is a good idea? I have money for KN95 but it would still be an investment I would rather spend on prepping.

Shouldn't people who have goggles (eg, for carpentry work etc) use them when they're in public - in addition to a mask?

I mean, if the virus is in the air, you could get it directly in the eye!

Yeah, there is the part where you would look like ET but it would be small price to pay to reduce chance of death!

remdesivir study has no control group, same with didier raoult's hydroxychloroquine trial, but is getting pretty much only positive press, unlike hydroxychloroquine which is being touted by the media as a scam.

what's the difference here?

i don't have a bias toward either, and am optimistic about both since there were anecdotes about both drugs curing seemingly hopeless patients as far back as january.

I‚Äôm not sure medically the difference, but I think remdesivir was picked up in the news channels recently because of some heart warming story of a doctor in Florida.

There are also a few other therapeutics that are being tested right now.

There‚Äôs not going to be a control group, it‚Äôs supposed to be a short treatment vs long treatment trial. There‚Äôs no control group where patients aren‚Äôt taking the drug.

No difference in that regard vs hydroxycut.

But the prelim results were so good that most patients didn‚Äôt even stay in the hospital long enough for the 10 day treatment. Most were discharged earlier than that.

So again, no control, but that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much hype.

My quick on line search for why some people are asymptomatic when they have covid 19 turned up nothing. I'm hoping that the reason is the asymptomatic people have a healthy immune system that quickly and effectively deals with the intruder before symptoms appear.

I'm going to guess that the asymptomatic people tend to be younger and with no pre-existing conditions. But even old people like me might be asymptomatic if we are healthy.

And healthy people can be symptomatic too. Being healthy with a immune system does not give you 100% protection. You have a major advantage but be diligent and keep to the guidelines / measures.

I'm on day 7 of fever and gastrointestinal upset. Luckily my fever is responsive to meds, otherwise I don't know what I'd do. I've had two telehealth visits with two separate doctors and they both said that I do not meet all the criteria for testing in MI, but to assume it is related to the coronavirus outbreak. Here's the kicker: I haven't left my house aside from walks since March 16. I stopped going on walks at the beginning of the month because I was uncomfortable with neighbors congregating and talking outside. My husband and I have had groceries delivered, which we clean diligently. So I really do think it's corona just because of how contagious this bug would have to be. And I haven't had a fever since I was a child, yet every day my fever comes back when the meds wear off. I'm so over being sick. Especially with fever. The shakes and shivers that happen when my fever starts to climb can be so intense and it feels so dangerous and scary. I can't believe how stubborn this bug is and that I'm still experiencing symptoms. I'm scared of my husband becoming symptomatic, but so far nothing. He runs fun centers so his immune system is really robust, except for strep. In January he had the worst respiratory illness I've ever seen him deal with. His lungs rattled and whistled for a week and he really struggled to breathe through all the coughing fits. I didn't get it, which shocked both of us. His swabs tested negative for influenza A/B and Strep, so who  f***ing knows if we don't have access to tests. I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe to know I'm not the only one who has experienced this. Maybe to find out when I can expect this to wane? Just please stay inside if you can. Stay safe.

I wish I had something better to tell you than hang in there, I'll be praying for you and your husband because right now, it's all I can do.

I also had a respiratory virus from hell in late December early january, but I never got tested. One of my uncles also had a horrific respiratory virus, but like your husband tested negative for influenza A and B. I don't know what my uncle, myself, and your husband had, but Jesus christ was that horrible. Makes you wonder if it wasn't here a lot earlier than we thought

Life will start getting more normal before we‚Äôre too deep into summer, that‚Äôs what we know. You will almost certainly be able to enjoy your summer as long as you‚Äôre using social distancing techniques.

My plan is to drive to places where people in my area don‚Äôt go to often and go on peaceful hikes. Or if the trails get crowded, I might just go for a drive through a pretty part of my state, bringing a supply kit with me in case something goes wrong on my drive.

In some ways yes, in some ways no. Most of us will be back to work if our jobs still exist, at some point this summer we‚Äôll be able to go to bars and restaurants, though capacity will be limited. Sports will be back, but fans won‚Äôt.

But who knows, we need to have so idea of just how many people have actually had it before we really know what‚Äôll happen. If it‚Äôs 5-6% of the country (unlikely to be this low) this summer will be miserable, if it‚Äôs 80% (unlikely to be this high), it could be basically normal.

That figure contains a lot of temporary layoffs. At some point, that number will see a historic drop when they go back.

Is a recession still coming, yes, but that unemployment figure will plummet when a huge chunk of those people go back to work

I use worldometers most often. Last night (or this morning) I went to bed at 1:54AM and the death count was at 28529 with 0 New on the counter and over 2.2K that day. I just refreshed the page and it says 33332 deaths with 744 New on the counter.

That's a 4803 death difference. I have a screenshot for proof: https://i.imgur.com/9beico6.png

Does anyone know why this would happen?

Someone with covid19 wont be dressing or being moved by wheelchair (they‚Äôll be moved bed to bed transport most of the time) and few in hospital will be eating while they fight for every breath. They need oxygen, a cannula, IV drips, and the ones who die are usually sedated and put on a ventilator first. They either get better and are allowed to wake up and the ventilator taken out, or they die in their sleep.

This is a cruel illness. The staff, who are trained in the modern medicine importance of touch, and the presence of loved ones, are being traumatised not just by the deaths but also the necessity of keeping every non-patient away from danger.

Some of my relatives did that for my grandma's birthday recently - different tables set up outside for a meal.

While probably safer, I still would have advised against it if they'd asked for input about it (I found out after). For starters, the 6 feet guidance has been shown to be way underestimated. Droplets have been shown to travel up to 27 feet. Talking to one another will cause aerosols, which can be carried on a gentle breeze over 20 feet away.

At a distance to be "safe," you'd have a more intimate interaction just having seperate dinners over video chat. You can get the whole family together easily, see them up close, talk without yelling, etc etc.

If you can't touch or be face-to-face anyway, I really don't see how in-person meetings are worth the risk right now.

It's better not to, but I guess you could eat on the driveway and your father is inside the garage with a substantial distance between one another.

That's what my parents and I do, but for a couple of reasons, most notably because we all got exposed together months ago thanks to my parent's cruise, we are kinda different

My parents, along with likely thousands of other retirees in Arizona, are gearing up for their seasonal trip back to their home state in the Midwest. What can I say to them to help them see that this is a bad idea and they need to stay put??

I would guess at primal capacity, but also may depend on the place. Private beaches for vacationers like Kiawah island SC‚Äôa private part, for sure they‚Äôll be open.

Giant beaches that are packed? Probably not

Hi everyone,

The lack of widespread testing and accurate COVID-19 infection statistics is a huge problem underreported case data allows public officials to fit the progression of the pandemic to their own narratives.

One way to compensate for the lack of rtPCR testing for active cases is to conduct serum surveys for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (evidence of a person with a resolved infection).

Ian Hilgart-Martiszus is a citizen scientist from Oregon who open-sourced a protocol anyone can use to test for resolved COVID-19 infections in their own community. He published the United States' first serum survey for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

We're hosting Ian for an AMA tomorrow (4/17) evening in hopes to spread this protocol for others to replicate in their own community with the goal of establishing more accurate data regarding COVID-19 prevalence

I've completely lost my sense of smell but have no other symptoms.. I can't find any NHS advice for this. I haven't left the house since March 20th but my parents have. I plan to distance myself from the rest of my family for a couple of weeks but should I be worried and should I be doing anything else?

Note: I do have a chronic illness, sinus problems, autism and sensory processing disorder, sometimes my taste buds go funny etc. so this could just be something my body is doing but it's pretty worrying timing

It could be a sign of COVID-19, but you mention sinus problems as well, so it's hard to tell. https://www.livescience.com/smell-loss-confirmed-covid-19-symptom.html

They only want to be called on 111 if it's an emergency (short of breath etc) and it's outside normal GP hours right now. I take Naproxen through, which I think was on the list they sent us about meds that might be dangerous so I will have to call tomorrow either way. My sinus issues are very rare and mild but they're inherited from my dad whose problems got worse as he aged so idk

I'm checking for my stimulus return, but have not been able to access my account on the IRS website. So I looked at my 2019 return, and it turns out that I checked the "someone can claim me as a dependent". I thought I had to do this because I'm under 25, but my parents haven't claimed my in 4 years. This prevents me from the original terms of the $1200, but can I amend it and get the money?

I say wait it out until you know you didn't get your 1200, they're still giving it out I think. Maybe it doesn't matter. But if you dont get the money, I'm going to say it will be really hard to ask for it and recieve it in its totality.

Not sure, you're a little too young for the earned income credit, but I'd do a quick test on a previous return to see what might exist for lower earners. It's credits you're looking for, which is basically free money.

Can coronavirus spread in common areas of apartment buildings? IE someone coughs in a stairwell then an hour later someone inhaled airborne particles and become infected?

It's likely aerosol spreading.

1 Hour is too long. But I would say if somebody is really infected AND is coughing without a mask on / covering his mouth in the last 10-20min it's possible to get infected in a closed room.

If you are outside with a bit of wind the aerosol will disapear in seconds even if somebody is trying the best to spread it.

Since that's the case with influenza I'd say it's safe to assume that it's also possible for COVID-19 to spread that way.

I don't think this is advertising since it's from an academic publisher. But you might like this book. It's about how the locals from Ebola regions of West Africa contained the virus. Very little had to do with expert assistance. This shows you how virus containment can be bottom up

If an infected person were to sneeze on a table in an open barn with a breeze, would the virus still have the potential to stay, on aforementioned surface, for 3 days? Asked differently, Is the virus sticky or would/could it blow away from a surface during in a strong or constant wind?

wind will disperse it further. Unless the table is in direct sunlight or the temp is about 90F I would say go with porous surface determination of 24hr.

Edit: or you could spray it down with a 3-5% bleach solution and let air dry, which is 10 minutes and Rona free.

Sticky. That's how it stays on your hands or whatever surface it's on, if not it would just be blowing in the air all over the place.

LOL. Congress appointed one (1) person to audit the loan records. I mean, I guess there's supposed to be some other committees, too, but overall you're looking at maybe 50-100 people meant to audit 4 trillion dollars in funding. And that's only once the various committees get together.

"1918 Flu Pandemic That Killed 50 Million Originated in China, Historians Say"

A prescient 2014 National Geographic article about how the "Spanish Flu" actually came from China

"I would say that the takeaway message of all of this is to keep your eye on China" as a source of emerging diseases, Higgins says. He points to concerns about avian flu and the SARS virus, both arising from Asia in the last decade.

No one is quite sure. In recent years I‚Äôve seen more and more scientists point towards China as the original origin

But some of that could just be because they lost the benefit of the doubt for continually being the source of major diseases for most of the 20th and 21st century

more than 33% of americans are obese, and very vulnerable. so we lock down roughly 123 million americans, then lock down the addition 32.5 million (The rest of the people over 65 who aren't obese but still very much at risk). that brings us to 219.5 million people on lockdown. How many of those people live with younger people or kids who can get it and bring it to them? Thats even more people on lock down. We haven't even gotten into people in this country with heart disease, with liver and kidney disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and cancer. Its not a plan that works, if it did 1 country would be doing it, and we'd be hearing about it (Either positively or negatively)

I keep saying this to people who say, 'It's only people with underlying health conditions who are dying, so most people will be okay'. A lot of people don't seem to realise that when you take into account old age, obesity, diabetes, asthma, vaping, heart disease, cancer sufferers, MS etc. every other person (at least) is technically in the 'at risk' category and for those that aren't they almost certainly are close to someone who is.

Don't know why you're getting downvoted for asking a genuine question..... the answer is because there's still a high risk of someone vulnerable catching it off of someone healthy if they live in the same space..... also many people will have underlying health conditions that they're unaware if that may put them at high risk.....

That‚Äôs not entirely true. We can do serological testing probably in a couple months and determine who‚Äôs already had it and can go back to work. The nice thing about that too is you can start contact tracing of people who were in contact with those infected.

I feel like we should stay locked down for at least another month or so, but we can't stay like this forever. People will be evicted, starve, etc. We'll enter a depression with no way out. I'm in the middle. I understand the importance of what we're doing, but on the other hand, this virus is not as bad as we first thought, and like I said, we can't just completely shut down for a year +.

I'm the last guy to ever compliment or commend Trump for anything, but a phased approach is a good idea. If things start to go bad, we take a step back. If they're ok, we phase forward.

We won't have to wait a year. If some governments can finally get their act together and put in a proper testing and tracking plan, gradual easing of restrictions can happen. Though May 1st is extremely unlikely.

We can't lockdown for a whole year. The longer in lockdown the harder hit the economy is which means more people struggling to make ends meet. Ideally what would be good is in a few weeks providing numbers go down then a slow and gradual reopening to closely monitor the situation and avoid a sudden spike in cases. But even after reopening still having some form of social distancing measures in place like a ban on gatherings. And really we need mass testing before we even reopen to get a better track of cases.

Ohio‚Äôs republican governor has been arguably the best governor dealing with the crisis. One of the first to lock down, and he‚Äôs been great through it all. He‚Äôs always been up front with us. He told us when we had 14 cases that the reality was 100k of us already had it. When this ends, Governor Mike Dewine is the one who will go down as the hero in this, and right now, I trust him more than any other politician in this country, because I know he‚Äôll do what‚Äôs right for this state

since population density also probably has a really strong correlation with how bad the coronavirus is in a given area, if someone was able to analyse the split of coronavirus cases by democrat vs republican count, the numbers would probably show you why

Does anyone think the mysterious deaths in the Dominican Republic last summer could be related to Covid-19? Several sudden deaths of people with respiratory illnesses and fluid in their lungs with no known cause. article

That seems too far out of the timeline. There are a lot of people who were sick with symptoms of the disease in late December early January in the US that I think would think have a much better chance than this.

Could be another rogue disease

NO, genetic tracing and tracking of covid-19 indicates it started no earlier than late October 2019.

At some point either we will find a solution or we won't. But if we don't, a bunch of people will die, most will survive, and we will continue on with our lives. We will mourn those that died but we will move on.

I think even going out to eat will be doable fairy soon, just at reduced capacity (and some of us will have to wait to eat at weird hours haha.

And concerts and games will be back eventually too. One day everything will move in

Some famous brand world class products are still only sold that way. "Not available in stores". And if you're choosing that life there's no advantage in selling crap products. I doubt you have anything but warm feelings about any of the brands I ever sold.

I was really very successful at it. I quit the business to settle down to family life. Life on the road is great when you're young and wild, but it makes for a poor parenting/partnership experience. Also, it does involve work with some people who were rather too interesting, who were more of the unsavory salesman stereotype I was always overcoming. Anyway, you sound like the kind of person who gets the call at work and says over the phone "if it makes you happy, buy it", or at most "tell the guy to come back when I'm home" - mostly so you could haggle price. Or who rejects me several times with good cheer until we talk specific brands, and then we're good. People can usually work out in a minute or two if you're totally legitimate, honest and fair.

Rejection is a big part of that life though. You have to get to where you accept it eagerly. I've seen a lot of it, even at the top of my game, even though my peers considered my ability in that regard uncanny.

For the short term then yh. But long term we'll eventually return to normal but it'll be a while atleast to full normality. This year will probably be a rocky year since we've still got to worry about how to lift the lockdown without a second wave. But hopefully we'll have a vaccine by next year or some form of treatment that we can return back to good old normal life. So it's not all doom and gloom

My dad just came home from a doctors appointment and tells my mom while he was waiting in the waiting room there's like 15 or 20 people in the room close together in the room and he tells my mom there was like 1 or 2 people who were wearing a face mask and some people had nothing on to protect themselves. He also tells my mom the staff did not have any kind of protection on and he even saw a guy and a girl snuggle up to each other. Would this be considered illegal and unsafe?

Huh. Mother‚Äôs local clinic has shifted all its doctors appointments to the car park. Patients wait in cars, and the doctors come to the cars of their next patients in line. Some of the consults are done at the car, but mum wound up outside her car, under the carport with her doctor to do hers.

Oh, that‚Äôs in Australia.

New York can absorb a lot of cases because it has a built-up Primary Care system.

A 500 case outbreak in screw your cousin county Arkansas is going to overwhelm whatever medical system is available in the area. Then there's the argument to ship them to a larger Center, what happens when all those were all areas start experiencing cases?

The population density of New York accelerates the pace of the infection. But it has nothing to do with the completeness of it. Left unchecked it will infect >82% of Arkansas and Montana also. It will just happen slower. The hospitals will not be overwhelmed as quickly in rural states, but unmanaged the epidemic will overwhelm them taking the loss of life from tragic to biblically apocalyptic.

Why aren't we putting non violentprisoners and homeless people inall the empty hotels snd motels? Gaurds could watch them there . It would put some money back in the community and save these people's lives. Can you imagine sitting there, watchingit t take your cellmates, wondering when it's going to get you? It's inhumane.

Most hotels and motels are private property. The owners probably don't want homeless people shacking up in their hotels and motels for the foreseeable future. There's the risk of damage, the need to require staff to upkeep the rooms (covid health hazard), and the concerns related to adequately cleaning every square inch of the hotel/motel afterwards to make sure there's no trace of SARS-CoV-2 afterwards. That last part is something that's a particular concern considering the Diamond Princess still had traces of viable virus 17 days after people were evacuated from the ship.

I just brought takeout to my parents. I put the bag on the floor, washed hands. Got plates/bowls from their cupboards. Unpacked the food onto the plates, stuffed the to go packaging in the bag. Washed hands. Got a wipe, wiped down the cupboard knobs and anything I else I may have touched, grabbed the bag and used the wipe to let myself out. It‚Äôs insanity but they are in their 80s and are sick of grocery food.

Honestly my heart kind of breaks for them because they are active, vibrant people. They used to go out for little errands, to the gym, etc every day but it sure seems like they‚Äôll be self isolating until vaccinations.

Your mouth and throat are not good paths for C19 infection either. There‚Äôs a small possibility that you could inhale a small amount of virus and get it to your lungs/airway. But it would have to actually encounter and infect the right kind of cell. There may not be enough of it to make that likely.

By the time you‚Äôve stacked all the odds together it just isn‚Äôt very likely that you would catch it this way. Not impossible, just very unlikely.

My entire infertility schedule went out the window. Even if i did get pregnant on my own, i need multiple dr appointments a month and have a higher risk of miscarriage, which could require a d&c which is out of the question currently. I went from actively trying to actively preventing, when all i dream and think of is having a child after suffering through 4 miscarriages.

I am fully for this lockdown because i am ONE person, and i can deal with my situation if it means keeping others safe. This is a serious situation.

Unfortunately you live in a country that spent decades voting for no social safety net, no support when you get in trouble, me-me-me, dog-eat-dog bootstraps-or-nothing kind of society.

You're under the mistaken assumption that your choice is, in your own words, 'senile gramps from nantucket' dying vs you having an income. The real choice is YOU dying vs you having an income. Maybe once you start to understand that your anger will subside a bit.

This sucks for everyone. Loss of income is temporary. Loss of life is not.

Because it's a loaded question. While hiding your real question behind the thin veneer of whether people " still agree with the lockdown" you are asking if people agree with you that it isn't worth it. It's manipulative, and transparently so.

I am an alcoholic of 20 years, and i have been given the rare opportunity to accept that it has become more difficult to obtain booze. My choice is no longer "to drink or not to drink", my choice has morphed into "make unnecessary runs to the store, or find something else to do". The added layer of choice, paired with the added layer of health risk has put my drinking problem into a brand new light. I actually see the "choice" for once. I am drinking a lot less, feel better, excersise more and find recreation in at-home projects that i had given up due to drinking.

Moral of my anecdote: its all in perspective

That's putting it quite harshly. No, I don't think anyone should just shove off and die, but we're literally dealing with an unprecedented global event that's affecting all of us, albeit in different ways.

It's not ideal for any of us, but it is what it is. If we do nothing, we overwhelm hospitals, many more will die, including those who haven't been affected, but need other medical attention, that they won't get, because of the aforementioned situation of hospitals being overwhelmed.

You're probably getting downvoted because a lot of other people, who may also be hurting, realize why we're doing what we're doing and are putting the greater good ahead of their own.

Why is the death rate calculated by deaths/cases vs deaths/resolved cases?

When I look at that, the rate of death is around 40% as opposed to 5ish% (in the USA)

A lot of cases aren‚Äôt being marked as resolved. Many people will test positive, be sent home to sel-quarantine and not be tested again. Eventually they will be marked properly, but the data on number of deaths, new cases, and new hospitalizations are probably considered higher priority. We definitely know that rate of death is no where near 40% so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to use that formula.

When studies have taken into considerations the number of asymptomatic people, the mortality rate is likely much lower than 5% even.

Exactly. There's no mechanism to report resolved cases other than people who are hospitalized then discharged. If you just recover at home you don't call in and say I'm better now to someone or anything.

Right. I‚Äôm sure they will be counted correctly at one point in the coming months and will provide useful information for us to look back on, but currently those numbers aren‚Äôt very reliable.

Right but that‚Äôs not how death rate is calculated. You won‚Äôt have a outcome for all cases because you can‚Äôt call every person who tests positive to get an outcome.

Do public pools pose a threat? I know DeBlasio said no public pools in the city will open this summer but I feel like that‚Äôs because they are indoor, but what do you think about the rest of the state?

You'll never be 100% "safe" from exposure to germs and viruses. You are constantly at risk of exposure even from your own family members inside the house. People will just need to RELEARN how to not be paranoid and hysterical thanks to the media.

There is no evidence that covid can spread via water bodies, and public pools are basically bleached so they should be safer than the average body of water.

Families of Healthcare Workers Who Die from COVID19 Deserve Financial Support/Scholarships Petition

Throughout this pandemic, there is one standout sector of our workforce that is tirelessly battling COVID-19 on the frontlines on behalf of the people of the United States: our healthcare workers.

Our nation is at war with an invisible foe. Like our military on the battlefield, doctors, nurses, EMTs, ambulance drivers, morgue attendants, hospital security staff, lab techs and others are putting their lives in peril 24/7 to care for the sick and dying and to provide comfort to their families.

We‚Äôve seen in China and Europe that healthcare workers are dying by the hundreds; a number that may be significantly higher by the end of this pandemic. Unfortunately, the United States will be no different. Despite the efforts of federal, state and municipal governments to keep them safe, the pathology of this virus puts our healthcare workers at risk constantly.

We cannot allow their sacrifices to be in vain, and we cannot abandon them once this pandemic has passed.

Please join us and sign this petition to force Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing financial assistance and scholarships to the families of the dedicated healthcare workers who die from COVID-19.

It‚Äôs the right thing to do NOW!

SARS is caused by SARS-CoV. They are related. As the group that named them said, sisters. Because of the way viruses replicate (asexual replication) that means that the moment where they diverged was a mutation. Each has had several mutations since. The key divergence probably happened in a bat thousands of years ago.

Mostly fueled by the 3215 deaths in a day in New York. Maybe it's just too early, but I haven't seen any coverage of where that spike came from. It blew away the previous day's death toll of 775 by a more than a factor of four and increased the overall death toll of the whole virus in New York by 28%! What the hell?!?

New criteria probably. edit: and if the numbers coming from Europe can provide any sort of guidance, I'd say the death toll will remain quite high for awhile. Things are about to get very tense I think.

But the figure likely includes "probable" deaths related to COVID-19, which were not previously included. This week, New York City announced it would add 3,778 "probable" coronavirus deaths to its toll.

You do realize they think they will have a vaccine that they have 7 billion of in April of 2021. If we kept lockdown through 2021 this country will collapse. Grocery stores are already dwindling, food factories are closing, workers in the south who grow our food are unemployed, amongst the other 22 million people. We have been on lockdown for 1 month and 22 million people are unemployed. We can‚Äôt even go thru the summer on lockdown or else we‚Äôd see a catastrophe. If we did what u said and waited until we had a vaccine, not only would probably more people starve to death in this country, but then we‚Äôd get a vaccine and no one would have any jobs to go back to.

Christ! I wish people could understand that buying stuff like home decor, furniture, paint from big box retailers is not essential. You can still buy all that stuff at retailers under 50,000 sq ft. Big box retailers over 150,000 sq ft need to reduce their foot print in order to help the employees be able to proper clean and sanitize. Have you ever tried to clean every sq ft of a 150,000 sq ft building everyday with over worked, exhausted staff? It‚Äôs impossible.

She‚Äôs trying to stop people from leaving their homes out of boredom. Reducing the amount of times one needs to stop and gas up at the gas station. All the items that are on restriction from big box retailers can be bought online, curbside pick, or from smaller mom and pop local businesses. We have the 3rd highest amount of cases. People are still going about their lives like this isn‚Äôt spreading.

So you think we should just allow hundreds of people to continue to come into these places and hangout out of boredom? It‚Äôs snowed here for the last two days. You can‚Äôt plant anything anyway. Why does someone need new furniture at this time? The retail ads have been begging for someone to stop people from coming in for anything other than groceries or medical supplies. She‚Äôs not saying you can‚Äôt buy it. And honestly the big box retailers could have said these items can only be delivered or curbside pickup. Instead they gave poor direction to over worked under paid associates to block off stuff that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be blocked off. People are dying daily, our only priority should be flatten the curve.

People can still buy this stuff! It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been banned to purchase. You just can‚Äôt get it from Walmart or any other large retailer that sells multiple categories. Menards here is offering online orders with curbside pickup. That‚Äôs not unreasonable. People can go to Ace Hardware for paints. The CEO‚Äôs of Walmart, Lowe‚Äôs, Meijer didn‚Äôt push back, they did it because it protects there associates. Who are risking their health everyday they go to work.

They seemed less like they agreed with it and more that they were overruled into compromising. Their tone and the document itself sounds like a compromise to me. Scripted by politicians but carefully worded by scientists to cover their bases as best they could.

I get a little of the same impression with Birx, although she's done very well not letting that get in the way of doing her job. I think Fauci is getting a little tainted by the politics (walking back his interview comments a day or two ago so as to not get fired). He seems like such a pure guy just doing the job he was meant to do, I wonder if it's hard for him to have to toe the line and keep the boss happy even in such an important role during a crisis.

What is the obsession over this? YES 30 million died in China and not one person managed to get this information out to the world. Authoritarian government doesn't mean people don't have access to the internet. They are not NK. China is a modern nation that is not closed off to the World. No way are they able to hide something of that magnitude.

Besides, I thought the Conspiracies regarding Covid were largely in the " it is fake." variety? Can't be both.

I don't think the people claiming it's a hoax are the same people claiming that numbers are undercounted... that's kind of silly to assume

Also China may be "modern" but the internet access of its citizens is absolutely controlled and heavily censored. I'm not saying that 30 million died but doubting their official numbers, whether because of willful undercounting or just logistical issues, isn't ridiculous just because Chinese media sources haven't been reporting undercounting.

Bunch of weak, scared, and soft people on this subreddit.

The world has always been cruel. Humans are smart but now we have a pandemic the world was not ready for. Luckily its not that deadly.

At the end of this month things will open up in a lot of areas. If you don't like it you can stay at home. If you want to stay in isolation till you are vaccinated you can do that. You can quit your job to make this possible. You may find that you need money but then you will be faced with same quandary as the nation. Your livelihood, or your safety. Get mad all you want but you still get to choose.

I assume that you are going to be a poster child for heard immunity. You are and about, take public transportation, worry nothing about infection. Good for you. Hope you are one of the lucky who show no symptoms.

If I gave you a bowl of 100 skittles and said, oh, by the way, there is something like 1 to 10 of them that will kill you and probably another 20 that will put you in the hospital. How many you going to grab?

Stupid question.

It's about sustainable restrictions. We had zero chance of being able to shut down until vaccine was administered to population.

I think Swedon had a more honest view of how this would play out. I think a lot of areas shutdown out of fear rather than a need alleviate burden on hospitals.

My post is about this subreddit. Noone will stop you from taking extreme measures but dont act superior when other people dont want the same thing. They probably imagine things playing out differently than you.

We just received amazon packages with baby food. I only had one glove so I wore that, brought them in, opened them and took everything out, and now they are at our front door to wait 72 hours. Afterwards, I washed my hands twice (three times really cause I ended up having to pee after). Is it alright that I didn‚Äôt wear a mask or should I have? Also, if I wipe everything down with a Clorox wipe, do I need to wait 72 hours? I saw a lot of speculation about people getting it from packages and I just want to be safe.

The corona virus is of the easier variety to kill. 72 hours after a wipe is not necessary.

It's very unlikely you will aerosolize the germ so a mask is not necessary either.

I think most businesses are prepared for reduced production, reduced customers etc.

No one is prepared for not being able to do anything at all because outside of certain places in the US in 1918-1919, that‚Äôs never happened. Businesses are prepared for lower demand, and issues that limit business. No one thinks to prepare for everything shutting down

With the exception of businesses like Microsoft who sit on giant piles of money. Bill Gates famously mandated that MS had to always have 1 year of operating capital in reserve after they almost went bankrupt due to a cash crunch when they were first starting.

But you're right. Companies generally get business insurance for this type of thing instead of sitting on cash.

Here's a chart (from statmap.org) showing US cases/deaths plotted against world numbers:

https://www.statmap.org/data/charts/chart4.png

The US has become a huge outlier.

While it is certainly disproportionate, keep in mind that some places that are almost assuredly among the largest case centers (China) are clearly lying about their numbers, and other countries where there should be a reporting a ridiculous amount of cases (India) don't have the best testing and reporting due to logistical difficulties.

regardless of how widespread the outbreak is in the US or how the testing is going or how the US healthcare system compares to other western countries, a huge chunk of the global population has basically no chance of being tested and has much less access to healthcare than even someone who's uninsured in the US.

Is a second wave 100% going to happen or is it just very likely? Like even if we get on top of our shit after we reopen is it still possible we'll have another outbreak of COVID19 worse than this?

Possible. What is unknown is what percentage of the population has contracted the disease and had no symptoms or mild symptoms. The higher that percentage is, the less likely a second wave will be as serious as the first, and vice versa.

If we do not have a system in place to track new cases once the caseload becomes small enough, then yes a second wave is 99% going to happen (I dont know the future for sure). Even if we do, it still probably will. China, who had the strictest lockdown (welded peoples doors shut) is struggling to keep it down.

Since only about 5% of the population will have been infected, expect a second wave. What's important is how prepared we are for it. There needs to be widespread rapid testing available and contract tracing to prevent small outbreaks from spreading undetected.

China's in this stage right now and they're finding it difficult.

A second wave is very likely, but nothing is a guarantee.

The second wave, in theory, shouldn't be nearly as bad. Looking at history, the successive waves usually have a lower peak. But that's dependent on good measures to track cases.

In this case, the virus has no problem finding new hosts. I wonder if that general rule applies more to fast-killing diseases with no asymptomatic carriers.

Right now when the virus is weaker it goes undetected or only mild symptoms which allows it to spread unimpeded, if it got more severe the patients would be either bed ridden, die, or be in hospital under strict contamination restrictions

It‚Äôs far easier for the virus to spread more if it gets milder

It is possible to have a slight fever and not realize it though. You get hot and/or shivery for an hour or so and then you're fine and you don't even really register it.

In the United States Covid19 deaths are currently at 31,000. Regaular flu deaths in the US alone this season are at 62,000 including 78 children. If social distancing measures were necessary to save lives and as effective as everyone says why would we not continue social distancing and quartine in order to save lives lost to regular flu spread through the community each season? Are those lives not equally improtant? If someone out there supports social distancing and quarantine for Covid please explain why you would not ALSO want to save lives each flu season?

You‚Äôre missing the context of the numbers completely. The 60000 dead per flu season is an after the fact estimate based on annual models. It‚Äôs not like they have 60000 confirmed dead people from the flu per year. The number of confirmed lab deaths from influenza is much, much lower.

The 31k number you are citing for USA deaths is the number of confirmed deaths in the middle of the pandemic. The number is so undercounted at the moment that we cannot even fathom how to find a correct number. We just don‚Äôt know and won‚Äôt until after the fact when the CDC will do their modelling and come up with an estimate. I guarantee it will be far, far higher than the 60k dead from flu a year.

Think of this example. There were 18k lab confirmed deaths from the h1n1 pandemic and the WHO estimate for deaths after the fact was between 150k-575k dead.

You‚Äôre just missing the context and you‚Äôre argument is dangerous. Please rethink your position and begin to understand why this disease is so scary to so many.

The point of my question is this. What # of deaths is acceptable to people if coronavirus (like the flu) continues to mutate each year and there's never a 100% safe vaccine. What # of deaths are people willing to tolerate to either continue or discontinue current social distancing measures? Also do you have a link to the actual stats saying flu deaths this year are much lower?

You‚Äôre looking at the question wrong. It‚Äôs about uncertainty. There‚Äôs no specific number. We don‚Äôt know what to expect with this new virus. We‚Äôre basically in the dark with it.

With a flu vaccine and living our normal lives we can reasonably expect x amount of deaths every year from influenza. We are ok with it because we know so much about the virus, we have done what we can to stop it (vaccine), and it is fairly predictable.

Within virus we are completely in the dark and basically don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing. That‚Äôs why it is so scary and that‚Äôs why we are taking the social distancing measures we are taking.

In your scenario about if we never have a 100% safe vaccine and covid-19 mutates every year, I think it is possible that we get to a point with a reasonably effective vaccine and reasonably predictable infection and death rates every year. In that case I see no reason why covid-19 couldn‚Äôt become similar to the flu in terms of how we treat it. But we‚Äôre not there yet and we‚Äôre not close.

I love how you went to the CDC website, saw the deaths are forecasted to be between 24,000 and 62,000 for the year and went with the highest. Nope, no way you have an agenda here.

Because the flu has a vaccine out every year that if people would take it, there would be fewer deaths. Sometimes they target the wrong strain and it doesn't help, but it's usually effective.

The pick three strains and they are frequently wrong about which strain hits the hardest here in the US resulting in the amount of death you see in their figures. Globally it's of course worse.

There‚Äôs also no proof it came from some bat in a cave. I wouldn‚Äôt think anything of the BSL4 lab story except it is remarkably close to that wet market. I mean if this virus had been found in any other city in China, this wouldn‚Äôt even be a story.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. There‚Äôs plenty of evidence this virus was not engineered. That paper was published a few weeks ago in Nature Medicine and is pretty convincing.

If you are being claimed as a qualifying relative by your parents you cannot get a check. If not, IRS.gov has a non-filer tool that you could use to get a check. Make sure you are not able to be claimed.

Incorrect

The IRS requires four tests to be passed for a person to be classified as a qualifying relative.

The qualifying relative must not be a qualifying child of the taxpayer or of anyone else; no taxpayer can claim them on their tax return as a qualifying child. 2. The qualifying relative must either live in the taxpayer's household all year or be related to the taxpayer as a child, sibling, parent, grandparent, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, certain in-law or certain step-relative. Someone who is not technically related to the taxpayer can become a qualifying relative by living with the taxpayer all year, and someone who is related to the taxpayer‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt live with them‚Äîcan be a qualifying relative. A person who died during the year but lived with the taxpayer until death or who was born during the year and lived with the taxpayer for the rest of the year is considered a qualifying relative, even though that person didn‚Äôt live with the taxpayer for the full year. 3. The qualifying relative must have a gross income of less than $4,200 in 2019. This amount can increase every year. 4. The qualifying relative must have received more than half of their financial support for the year from the taxpayer.

#2 clearly includes children. #1 doesn't exclude a child over 24, because a child over 24 isn't a qualifying child.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't we ALREADY have a Covid vaccine?

We already had a Cov1 outbreak in 2003, and the antibodies produced to fight off Cov1 are the same as the antibodies produced to fight off Cov2.

Shouldn't we just weaponize an antibody treatment based on a dead strain of Cov1? Like the flu shot.

The antibodies are not the same. The spike protein has mutated since then. Besides, antibody treatment isn‚Äôt a vaccine. It is a short term treatment that can help the sick, but provides no long term benefit. You have to teach the B cells to make the antibodies to this COVID. The way to do that is to inject a portion of the covid (one lab is using the spike protein) to teach the B-cells to look for this antigen specifically. The B-cells will hopefully do that for the rest of your life, or you‚Äôll eventually need a booster shot.

Since SARS disappeared in 2004 there wasn‚Äôt a rush in a vaccine.

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre testing to see whether Cov1 antibodies do anything to Covid19

This is what I thought. I haven't seen anything in the mainstream US news about this though and it's concerning.

This seems like a practical thing to test very early on.

As I recall the vaccines that were in development for SARS did cause the lab animals to develop antibodies for the virus. And then when they dosed the animals with virus, their immune response killed them all. Immunological toxicity. And then SARS went extinct in the wild and nobody pays for research into a vaccine for an extinct virus because the cost and risk is high and the potential market small. And they don't let you infect humans with a deadly extinct virus to see if your vaccine worked, so human testing for efficacy had certain pragmatic difficulties anyway.

A vaccine for SARS2 may run into the same problem. Scarily, after the immunity wears off a second round might be truly terrifying. That happened with Spanish Flu. Cytokene storm they called it. The first year it took out the old and feeble. The second year it took out the young and healthy with alarming speed.

This might prolong the release of an effective vaccine, based on the potential immune response. If we learn from our mistakes, then we may need to prolong a long term vaccine even longer then, just to be sure it will actually be as effective as needed.

Otherwise we may end up doing more harm than good, rushing a vaccine.

What will the narrative construction projects of the day be here in r/coronavirus?

Will it be the righties focused on the "injustice" of California providing financial assistance to undocumented people in their state?

Will it be the lefties seeking to paint the inanities of the righties calling for lifting of stay-at-home orders as "dangerous" and "idiotic"?

Will it be more of Taiwan vs. China each doing its best to have the narrative of the unfolding of the pandemic best suit their roles in it?

Will it be Amazon looking to downplay their failings at protecting their employees from becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2?

Will it be the chloroquine proponents further expounding on the life saving benefits of the drug vs. those saying otherwise?

Will it focus on those decrying the adoption of face mask laws as not-scientifically sound while the proponents cite science indicating otherwise?

Will it be WHO proponents looking to downplay their failings leading to this pandemic or will it focus on opponents calling for an end to WHO and their "corrupt" leadership?

Let's find out on today's stories from the pits of r/Coronavirus!

Why the emphasis on testing and why to people think it is so important? The numbers are off regardless. It does not change the treatment plan or approach. There are people weeping because they can‚Äôt get a test, but it is not like they have pill they will give you if it is that they would deny you if you don‚Äôt. If you need medical assistance for breathing problems it is the same approach for severe bronchitis as it is for coronavirus. If you are sick you should self quarantine wether it is coronavirus or the flu, spreading it can have deadly consequences so stay home if you are sick with anything. Am I missing something?

If you want states and cities to get out of lockdown, you need three things:

point of origin diagnostic testing. This means, local doctors able to test a patient for covid-19 and get results back quickly.

Quick and efficient serological testing. This means, the ability to see if someone has already had the disease and has antibodies for it. This helps prevent health care workers from being quarantined for no reason, and allows workers to get back to work without need for isolation or quarantine.

Efficient contact tracing of patients who test positive for covid-19. This way you can have people who have had contact with an infected person self-quarantine until they have been tested for the virus.

But they are already just telling all suspected cases to self quarantine, why send someone out to get a test when doing so risks exposing more people. If they want you to remain in quarantine, then shouldn‚Äôt everyone with a fever and/or cough should just stay home. Maybe text or email their county and let them know they have a suspected case? Even with positive cases it is too big for contact tracing now. Why not just produce and stock pile the tests so we have plenty available to take those measures once the number of cases gets to a point where we can actually manage that?

A - Testing broadly and quaratining specific people

vs

B - Testing specific people and quarantining broadly

While flattening the curve of the first (hopefully only) wave, countries have to do B. Once the outbreak is relatively under control, they can switch to A.

Because you can be asymptomatic for several days, while being contagious to those around you? Why wouldn't we want to idenitify as many positive cases as possible, early on. Why is it too big for contact tracing now? The most successful nations have utilized contact tracing and aggressive isolation standards. Agreed that anyone showing symptoms close to Covid-19 should self-quarantine, regardless of being tested or not.

yes. yes, you are.

if you don't have adequate baseline testing, you don't have a handle on the contours of the virus in your population. if you don't have that, you don't have any reliable idea of its extent, lethality, etc.

you don't need any special medical training to get this. You basically need to knoww how to add subtract, multiply & divide. You need the basic reasoning skills you'd probably picked up by 5th grade in most US public schools.

Yikes. Imagine thinking a youtube montage of tweets from random people is a reliable source of information. Most of the tweets aren't even first hand information. You posted a youtube video of people tweeting that they heard from someone else that COVID-19 was put as a cause of death on a death certificate. Zero actual death certificates were presented as evidence.

Is anyone in either of your social circles a person in a risk group? If no then you should be ok but be cautious

Buy your food before you go to last two weeks so if you do get infected you don‚Äôt spread it to your community and make sure not to do anything reckless while you‚Äôre gone

This sub likes to overreact in my opinion and at some point we have to get back to life to some and we got to take precautions but we can‚Äôt lock ourselves inside forever

because i have several personal friends whose entire family are sitting at home with covid symptoms, and are being refused tests. thus we can assume based on how contagious this is, there are other people in the same boat. this leads people to not trust the numbers, as more and more people are in my shoes and my friends shoes.

Guy here strongly believed he has COVID19. Goes to hospital. Since he doesn't have any health insurance, they wouldn't test him. Said he at least got in the quarantine room, and there were plenty of kits, but for insurance reasons he couldn't be tested.

I have a hard time understanding why the US economy won't open back up. To me, everyone realizes by now the situation we are in. I believe if everyone just goes outside and goes to work, just wear protective gear. Masks, disposable gloves. Just don't touch your face and wash your hands. Social distancing seems to me to be an option for people who aren't using protective gear. Am i wrong?

It will open back up, but nobody is going to go for a shopping trip if there‚Äôs a fear they‚Äôre going to contract this thing. I mean no way in hell I stop by some clothing store then hit Olive Garden. There‚Äôs no way.

You trust 300+ million people to do this?

How many times have you been to a public bathroom and noticed someone not wash their hands? How many times have you not washed your hands after the bathroom? How many times have you used your phone on the toilet and later whipped it out on public transit or at a restaurant? Or put the phone up to your face to make a phone call?

Most people don't understand how to properly use a mask and gloves. I see people put on gloves and then proceed to wear them for an extended period. I seen people touch their phones with gloves on, or worse, take the glove off to use the phone and then put it back on. I see people adjust masks, or pull them down to talk to someone.

People don't have the budget to survive 12 months and the government can't just supply living wages for America for over a year when there's no economy. At some point you have to try to start opening up the economy, ESPECIALLY before a vaccine is found (which could take years.)

Lots of caveats in the wording of the story. Basically saying 'this is speculation and the conclusions could be wrong'. So not put much stock in it unless more information comes to light. Based on the initial cases, the most likely source still remains the Wuhan wet market.

I'd like to see what a virologist's opinion is of the likelihood of this narrative.

Right wing populists and their cronies thrive on "Us vs Them" scenarios. With no fabricated enemy, they'd never be elected.

Fox "News" isn't a reliable or credible source of any kind. In fact, if anything, they're a mouthpiece for Trump, and he's a master at deflection when the spotlight is on him in any sort of negative way.

This has been a changing conspiracy theory since January and the reality is, we'll probably never know. For now, we know that at a genetics level, it wasn't engineered in a lab, and the chair of the joint chiefs says the weight of evidence is that this didn't originate in a lab either.

Well, for one, the other guy already responded to say what you did. You saw that. I apologized to him.

Two, I do know what it stands for, I just missed it. Again, I apologized for that.

But while we're on the subject, I don't see how it's a meaningful measurement of anything. It would be like taking testing scores from gifted children and then saying "This is how smart all kids in the US are," when clearly it's not representative of what's really happening.

Anyway, it's all cleared up now... for a second time!

I'm on the F1 visa, but graduated last year. Started working (with OPT) mid Dec 2019 and have now stopped due to the pandemic we're in.

Just want to know if people like me would qualify for the stimulus check?

Because everywhere I check, it says that only citizens and resident aliens (green card holders) qualify.

But then again I am:

No longer a student (not enrolled in any institution)

Impacted by the situation (had to stop working)

Really dependent on the paycheck I was receiving

I absolutely do not feel entitled to it and I understand that there are priorities, citizens more in need than I probably am, just wondering :)

I believe the minimum is $600. If you made that or more before Dec 31, you should file (check the irs website to be sure that's the min). File deadline is extended so you can still do so.

Why do people keep saying this? It's not about the stock market. It's about low-income and middle-class people who no longer have a job. Rich people don't care! A crashed economy affects the poor more than the rich in a country with little safety net. The rich have savings and more connections and can ride this out.

I don‚Äôt get this. Theoretically the low income and middle class have their bailout - assuming Florida which has dog shit unemployment benefits of $275/week. Add $600/week from the federal government. $1,200 one time CARES stimulus.

Through July that comes out to about $23/hour in benefits if you‚Äôre unemployed. That‚Äôs probably MORE than someone in the lower class makes.

Now the rollout and delays of the unemployment benefits has been crap - but that‚Äôs a separate issue. At least it is retroactive.

Because it's true. People understand, people are living that this shutdown is disproportionately impacting lower income wage earners. and maybe it's with that realization that social change will start, richest country in the world has a third-world security blanket.

watching $30,000 a year Blue collar Joe sixpack vote for the hedge fund billionaire, is what got the country of this problem. People stopped caring about the political needs of your country and now they've lost everything out of that political mindset stopped caring about them.

20%+ of Americans lost their income. Try going to the store and paying with 'saving lives coupon'. I have been fortunate because, actually saving more now and maxing out 401k/IRA. 5 million + unemployment claims each week. How about you ask a waitress with 2 kids that lost her job, can't pay rent, how she feels? Buuuut but I am saving lives

You build walls because your country is xenophobic, and subscribed to ideals of racism. But instead you call it American exc√©ptionalism and it's all okay.

The problems you're facing here is because of your cultural, social, political and wealth division.

American propaganda is strong and widespread, countless millions have salt fortune and instead get chewed up spit out and buried. I'm sure plenty of red white and blue wearing Americans would be happy to crawl over a hundred thousand unlucky ones if it means they can get their white picket fence, three car garage, and two weeks at Disney World.

But what about South Dakota and the Smithfield plant? No mitigation in place in that state and so far 644 cases connected to the outbreak at the plant. The economy is in trouble either way, but one way doesn‚Äôt involve unneeded deaths.

Not in the slightest. Stay at home orders, increased hand-washing, social distancing has worked to slow the spread. Also, as noted in other comments, the US is a car-centric society that (outside of NYC) don't often use public transportation or have crowded sidewalks and public areas. This seems to me to be a big difference in the US. These things combined have help slow things down but people ignoring things or thinking its been long enough can counteract all of that.

No. Projections change all the time due to the trend not remaining the same. Having a lockdown in place and most people staying at home it will end up slowing down the curve that less people get infected and hopefully in turn reduces the number of deaths. Whole point of a lockdown is to prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed and having even more deaths. So if we end up having less deaths then projected it just means the lockdown has been successful in that regard

US deaths reported April 15, not including New York's restatement increase of thousands: 2,763.

Maybe, maybe not. What is considered acceptable loss? Many people will have varying opinions on that. Hindsight will always come back to haunt people.

Partially. It was never going to be bad in areas built wide versus tall. The issue is the size of the vast size of the United States, and the difference in civic structure and density. There was no approach that would be one size fits all.

The response was also late as  f***, and there was an attempt to compensate for it. In short, it is what it is. It be like that sometimes. Aaaaye.

Edit: Governors Prime Minister orders the extensions, not epidemiologists. Luckily for people with a conscience, a lot of governors are he is seeking advice from epidemiologists along with experts from a multitude of fields (including finance and economics) to make highly educated decisions. Now if only the "commander"-in-chief would do the same. Be grateful you have a leader that's doing the right thing, you twat.

I can understand the frustrations you and others might be feeling right now, but I really do think this a situation where we are required to look at the bigger picture, and taking the possible consequences of not treating this with the severity it's due into serious consideration

Testing and contact tracing is what they calling for and there is little federal support for this before reopen. Getting the infection rate to a manageable level and then reopening slowly is what public health professionals are arguing for. Watch a press conference and read a newspaper please or head back to thedonald.

So we should just let more Americans die than died in the Civil war? I don‚Äôt think you understand. We don‚Äôt have a choice. The only other option is MASS DEATH

A Modest Proposal, DNR Wristbands for those who wish to return to work or play.

Where your DNR wristband, go about your business. Yes, you will infect others. Yes, others may avoid you. Yes you receive only compassionate care if you get sick. Your choice.

I don't want to die with them. I sympathize, we all want our jobs back. BUT, the only way to get our jobs back without a LOT of death is to quarantine until we understand how to control this.

If YOU want your job back SO badly that you are willing to risk death, by all means, go for it. Just put your DNR arm band on so that after infecting me, you don't take up my hospital bed.

That's what this in reference to.

And while you're in your house self-satisfied by your isolation, who's keeping you there? Who's bringing the packages to your doorstep and the food to grocery-store shelves? Who's keeping your power and water flowing and hauling away your garbage? Who's patrolling the streets?

For some to self-isolate, others must work. We can't get through this with distancing alone. For you to sit in your house being pleased with yourself, a whole army of people has to get up and clock in every morning. Those people aren't "screaming for you to die with them." You need them.

I'm not "self-satisfied by my isolation", I'm annoyed and pissed off. I'm isolated because, the fewer people moving around, the slower the spread. I'm trying to be part of the solution so that others can carry on with required services.

I‚Äôm not sure where to post this but I saw this on Facebook pasted into a bunch of friends arguments over corona. Since I am wfh I am too busy to really look into but I was wondering if this checks out? NOTE: I am not agreeing with the below I just do not know how to properly argue against it.

*‚ÄùJohns Hopkins University of Medicine‚Äôs Coronavirus Resource Center, as of April 13 at 7:02 a.m., reported 557,590 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the United States and 22,109 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

The current population of the United States, according to WorldOMeters.info, is just over 330 million.

Do the math. That means 0.17 percent of America‚Äôs population has been infected by the coronavirus. That means 0.007 percent of America‚Äôs population has died from the coronavirus ‚Äî we think.

As Johns Hopkins also notes: It all depends on the testing.

‚ÄúWith more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio,‚Äù the site reported.

That means the number of positive coronavirus cases will increase as testing increases ‚Äî but very likely, the number of coronavirus fatalities will drop at the same time.

And by logical extension ‚Äî that means the number of recovery cases will hike, as well.

For this, we tank an entire economy?

‚ÄúMortality,‚Äù Johns Hopkins went on, speaking of coronavirus fatalities, ‚Äútends to be higher in older populations.‚Äù

Yes. And guess what else tends to be higher in older populations: death in general. Death due a variety of diseases, ailments, medical complications, health issues and ultimately, stoppages of hearts.

Older people die. That‚Äôs what they do.

For this, we abandon the Constitution and civil rights?

The numbers on coronavirus are ridiculously low. The justification for shutting businesses, closing schools, mandating social distancing, shuttering churches and congregations ‚Äî arresting pastors and park-goers and people who stand too close to others ‚Äî the justification for all is to keep the coronavirus numbers low, to keep Americans safe and healthy and free of sickness and death. Specifically, 0.17 and 0.007 percentages of the population low.

But look, we could narrow in and focus on any health ailment, cover it ad nauseam in the media; throw up real-time figures on the TV screen to keep people on their panicked toes; roll out the health experts to give their best medical advisements on how to avert a sickness ‚Äî with the pressure on for them to come up with new and better advisements as each day of non-stop reporting and media-fueled panic flows forth; and ‚Äújustify,‚Äù yes, ‚Äújustify‚Äù in quotation marks, national stay-at-home orders, and widespread closure of, well, everything.

We could do it, say, for the flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that from Oct. 1, 2019, through April 4, 2020, there were between 39 million and 56 million of flu illnesses; between 18 million and 26 million medical visits due to flu; between 410,000 and 740,000 hospitalizations due to flu; and between 24,000 and 62,000 of deaths due to flu.

The CDC says it doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äúthe exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza because influenza is not a reportable disease in most areas of the U.S.‚Äù But if we go by coronavirus standards ‚Äî so what? After all, the coronavirus models aren‚Äôt giving factual numbers. Neither, in some cases, are doctors and hospitals.

Shouldn‚Äôt we be throwing up real-time cases of flu deaths as they occur on television, alongside the ticking time counter of the numbers of those who‚Äôve contracted the ailment, alongside a map in glaring red and orange and yellow colors showing locations of the spread ‚Äî just so people can stay safe and protect themselves, dontcha know. After all, even lowballing gives some alarming percentages.

If 39 million Americans were sickened by the flu in the last few months, that‚Äôs nearly 12 percent of the population. If 18 million had to visit the doctor for the flu, that‚Äôs roughly 5.5 percent of the population. If 410,000 had to be hospitalized, that‚Äôs 0.12 percent. If 24,000 died from the flu during this time span, that‚Äôs 0.007 percent of all of America.

And that‚Äôs with a shot to prevent the flu. Now there‚Äôs a blaring story to report, in real, frightening death-count time, if ever there was one.

So where‚Äôs the alarm? Where are the medical experts? Where, by God, are all the face masks to protect you and me and all the good comrades out there tripping over themselves to measure out the proper 6-foot social distancing boundary?

Oh, of course, on the coronavirus, the health people say it‚Äôs all about what can happen that‚Äôs the danger. It‚Äôs all about prevention.

The health wonks ‚Äî and billionaire philanthropists who are focused on making vaccines for the world ‚Äî say the precautions of these last few weeks have saved us, and the precautions to come will save us even more.

Sure. Except the math doesn‚Äôt really add up. The math, in other words, is fuzzy.

And living on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù of unclear, panicking predictions isn‚Äôt exactly living. It‚Äôs surviving. It‚Äôs surviving in misery.

It‚Äôs high time for America to return to living ‚Äî before there‚Äôs nothing worth living for in America any more.‚Äù*

This is not just a flu.

Clearly either the people who quarantined most of the humans now living know something you don't know, or you know something they don't know.

Sorta but not really. It's a new tax credit that was advanced to you and does not need to be repaid if you aren't actually eligible. In short you don't need to worry about any additional in any taxes, but if you are actually eligible in 2020 and don't receive a check you can get it at 2020 tax time

So this is how I view it. in 2019 thousands of CEOs quit in unprecedented numbers https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/why-have-more-1-000-ceos-left-their-post-past-n1076201 . Google, Youtube, Twitter, and other sites cracked down on conspiracy theories and freedom of speech, allowing only approved content on their platforms. Late in 2019, event 201 took off, staging a "Corona Virus pandemic" just 1 month before the actual virus was noted in China. China suffered and the news media became hysterical. Slowly this creeping death made its way to America. Unfortunately, news media reported numbers and actual numbers did not add up https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fxe92l/chris_berg_on_twitter_why_is_mn_inflating_covid19/ . Independent journalists everywhere recorded video of empty ERs, hospitals, and tent set ups https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fteu2o/why_are_hospitals_empty_filmyourhospital/ . No one is falling out in the streets dead like we saw in China. Celebrities continue to be the biggest effected group, yet most of them miraculously recover. There is even a mysterious Dr. Creep video where he raps about "Coronavirus pandemic 2020" back in 2014. Any how, the news media continued to cry that the sky is falling, and the masonic politicians locked us down on house arrest over a virus that does not kill as many people as a bad flu year. This subsequently killed the economy, so a bail out was signed and a check was given to us all. This doubled the amount of fiat in circulation, and will cause mass inflation in the near future. A Great Depression is sure to follow, all because a virus that is no more fatal than the flu came into existence according to the script er I mean news. Soon, our masters, er I mean the scummy politicians, will lift our house arrest and let us go back to life, but not before taking our Constitutional rights away and forcing us to be vaccinated. Apparently it is okay for women to decide if they want abortions (our body our choice) but citizens can no longer choose whether they want to risk cancer and autism causing vaccines into their blood streams. Any questions? https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g2srmb/some_facts_that_i_do_not_dare_to_post_any_other/

There is no conspiracy here, move along profane sheep. This guy is crazy!

Freedom to think for yourself will bring down the wrath of this type of person. They can't handle the truth, so they instead label you crazy, or a tin foil hatter. This is the difference between freedom and slaves. Free people have the right to debate and learn about ALL sides of an issue, even if some of them are not popular and / or controversial. Indoctrinated slaves only get one official view allowed, and anyone who dares think for them self is instantly labeled a crazy. Good work u/itsmotaboutewe for doing us such a great service. Your place in 1984 is waiting!

People keep saying quarantine. I don‚Äôt know where you are located but in the US folks aren‚Äôt under quarantine unless they‚Äôre actively infected. There‚Äôs shelter in place orders. You can still go outside and exercise, take your dog to the park, etc. in most states. Just maintain social distancing while doing so and wear a mask. I‚Äôve seen some people enjoying time with friends far away from each other outside on the lawn.

Let‚Äôs be real. We are under an indefinite voluntary quarantine. Yes, it‚Äôs looser than an authoritarian lockdown. Calling it isolation or shelter in place or whatever doesn‚Äôt make different. We have a word for this that we understand. It‚Äôs quarantine.

I go for runs and try to go to the most deserted parks I can find when I do so. I run either by myself or with my GF who I basically live with

I technically break quarantine when I go to my parents to do laundry, but for a couple reasons I was told that was safer than using the laundry room at my apartment building (long story)

I'm no expert but if they are from Wish I would guess they are not very sturdy and also will take a long time to get to you if they are coming from China. To be cautious you may just want to not handle or open the package for 3 days once it arrives.

The KN95 masks from China are manufactured and packed for medical use in a sterile factory in airtight plastic packaging. If you're at all concerned someone breathed on the package when it was shipped 2 weeks ago, or in transit inside its plastic or cardboard outer packaging, you can sanitize the outside of the package before opening it.

Not that the virus could survive that shipping time unfrozen anyway.
