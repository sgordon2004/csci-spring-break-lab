A friend of mine from high school, her mother died of COVID-19 this weekend, she was 59 years old no health conditions and even ran a half marathon in the fall / ie was in good health for her age! So sad. It‚Äôs making me so angry that so many people I know aren‚Äôt taking this a little more seriously and not have huge Easter parties etc. Ughhh

My husband had to go on a grocery run yesterday. He wore a mask into Walmart. A woman walking in next to him stops him to say, ‚ÄúIf you have to wear a f***ing mask then you should just stay home‚Äù. Then rolls her eyes and walks away.

His dad is a doctor working through this mess right now and asked him to please wear a mask if he is going to be in any enclosed space with other people. Why are people still not taking this seriously?

The people who are bad mouthing others for wearing the masks are operating on the assumption that:

They don't have the virus.

They are not going to get the virus. (Invincible)

Are too proud to wear PPE of any type....

Don't have ppe to protect themselves.

Don't care if they die or infect others.

Have not lost anyone close to them to change their attitude on the virus severity.

ETC......ETC......ETC.......Delusion is GRAND!

That's the shit I don't get. From my understanding cloth masks worn by the public are meant to protect others from the wearer not the wearer from others so it's not being 'paranoid' it's being considerate. Not to mention even their president has said to wear them at this point. Some places are even requiring them. Why are the people who aren't following the general guidance being dicks to those who are instead of vice versa?!

A great deal of damage was done by health authorities and government leaders saying that masks used by ordinary people don‚Äôt help stop covid19 spreading. People usually believe the first thing they hear about a topic, and then it becomes very hard to change their minds if the first thing turns out to be untrue.

By that stage the first belief has became part of their identity, and accepting that part of your identity is wrong and must be ‚Äòdestroyed‚Äô is often very embarrassing and difficult.

Cognitive Dissonance makes people unaware of their own denial, faults, defects and misperceptions.....therefore the ability to see the truth even given objective data is skewed due to misaligned subjective data. Total psychological shit storm to say the least.

Oh yeah, the more I learn about the brain/mind biologically and psychologically the scarier it gets. We try to be rational, but we don‚Äôt often (usually?) operate that way. And I‚Äôm just as deluded as everyone else thinking most of what I know and think and decide is right. Especially my political positions!

The USA‚Äôs education problem is that their schools are funded at the local government level, and entirely dependant on the wealth or poverty of the community immediately surrounding the school. There is no equalising of school funds across a state or the nation. So America has anything from the best to the worst schools in the world. And far too many of the worst schools.

I agree! A public mistrust in health authorities is a very serious problem, which is why honesty and truth (even if it's harsh) should be the only option.

In this case, I think the damage is done.

They have done so much damage but the words they say.

Someone I live with their job was shut down because someone tested positive for coronavirus. A few days later CDC changed their guidance and now is saying if you have been near someone who tested positive you no longer need to self quarantine unless you show symptoms.

So they got a call saying everyone needs to come back in or lose their job and be ineligible for unemployment and the first thing they say is the CDC is letting people who test positive work unless they are showing serious symptoms.

And here I am I haven't left the house in three weeks I'm just waiting to get sick....

I install Hardscapes(patios, walkways, lightning, etc...) here in Ohio, where we are under stay at home. Well, my employer is still running crews during this! This is as non-essential type of work as there is-basic exterior home improvements. I am staying at home and not sure if I will still have a job because so. One guy I work with is a smoker, has asthma and has a 3 month yr old child at home, and is out installing patios. We roll on jobs with large vehicles, trailers, dump trucks, excavators... They are working only in out-laying areas(to avoid getting caught). None of my coworkers speak to me anymore. They think I‚Äôm a wussy. I‚Äôm so disappointed with them. My boss posts how ‚Äòwe are‚Äô taking this serious and following protocols. It‚Äôs very frustrating being stuck at home, but why risk it?

protect others from the wearer not the wearer from others

I do not understand this at all. I get it, that this is the official medical guidance, but let‚Äôs talk about me for a moment:

I am horrible about touching my face and my mouth. I‚Äôm a recovered nail-biter, but still nibble every once in a while. Something wierd stuck in my tooth? Let‚Äôs pry it out. I am thinking... let me rub my chin and mouth and think about that. I‚Äôm bored sitting here, let me rest my chin on my hand. Or I‚Äôm bored standing in this line at the grocery, let me lean my elbows on the cart and rest my chin on my hands. I could go on and on.

All that shit right there is why the mask protects me from others.

In my area Walmart is the safest option. It‚Äôs the closest place to get groceries within a 30 minute drive and it‚Äôs the only place that has been disinfecting carts and controlling how many people are in the store at one time.

Had the same response a month ago in NYC wearing masks and gloves in supermarket. People were angry and contemptuous of us. Since I am a nice guy, I hope they didn‚Äôt catch the COVID in the end. Wonder how they feel about masks now?

I'm not British, but I would've used this popular saying amongst the Brits to politely express dissatisfaction at another's opinion:

"f*** OFF".

And I would've said it really loud to that lady too.

Part of the issue is mixed messaging from governments, the WHO, etc. The person who said that may have heard the message that you should only wear a mask if you're sick. I guess I've been "sick" for two months then. I've been mask-shamed, I don't give two shits. I want to survive this and see better days.

People should be denied entrance if they aren't wearing a mask. No exceptions, strictly enforced. None of us should tolerate this level of idiocy during a pandemic.

For Easter my brother, his girlfriend, and their two kids went to visit my mother and stepfather. Brother is essential and works with the public. His girlfriend is a nursing assistant and works with the elderly. My mother has breathing issues and is hospitalized once a year on average for pneumonia. My step dad has leukemia. I wish there was an actual enforceable stay at home in my state so that they could be fined or arrested.

Your mother and stepdad could have told them to leave when they arrived. It isn't just your brother who is dumber than crap. I do suspect some people visit their elders in order to hurry along the expected inheritance.

Gold
My cousin in New York passed away from Covid-19. I called my aunt to lament and mourn with her, but I went completely blank on my phone call. I didn't cry, I didn't mumble; I just went completely blank, truly left without words. I tried to console her anyways, but my words were all over the place. I feel that my phone call was super awkward and that I made absolutely no sense. At one point, my dumbass said something along the lines of, "Well, we have to keep pushing forward and hope things will get better." I feel like an apathetic a---hole, although I am heart-broken (nowhere near to where she is, though). I cannot imagine how my aunt must be feeling right now. She did thank me for calling her and thinking of her. I ended the call by telling her I'll be praying for her (she's religious), that I'm thinking of her, and to count on me for anything (she's an immigrant and her and my cousins are poor). My aunt is such a wonderful, generous, and loving human being, and this is a reminder that Covid-19 can strike anyone.

When I call her this week, what are some things I can say to her? I've lost loved ones before, but never like this. I appreciate all the advice I can get!

When we lose loved ones I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the words that matter, it‚Äôs being present (not physically in this case, but mentally there with her on the phone) and supportive. There is no right or best thing to say, it‚Äôs fine to say I don‚Äôt know what to say to her. It sounds like you did just fine during your phone call to me. I‚Äôm very sorry for your loss.

Comments like this hit home for me. It's hard to make sense of the death tolls rising because they're just numbers. But in reality, all those numbers have a face, a name, a family, a favorite TV show... I can't imagine what you and your family must be going through, but if I try to put myself in your shoes and imagine someone close to me dying from this virus... I dunno what I would do.

Sorry for the loss in your family. I would repeat the words you wrote at then end of what you wrote here. Tell her what a wonderful and kind person she is and that you know your cousin was loved in his/her lifetime because he had her. Tell her you don‚Äôt have the words to say more but that they matter to you and you are there.

I‚Äôm so sorry you lost your cousin. You mentioned that your Aunt is religious. I suggest next time you talk to her ask if you can pray together or with her while your on the phone. I know this may sound odd to someone who is not Christian, but it will mean a lot to her. Just let her know how much you love her and that you will always be there for her family.

COVID Virus survival on masks, on different surfaces, temperatures and vs different disinfectants

https://covidpapers.github.io/posts/stability-of-sars-cov-2-in-different-environmental-conditions/#.XooRVhkGU04.reddit

Key points:

‚Ä¢ Virus can live on inner layer of mask at least 4 days and at most 7 days (U = Undetected)

‚Ä¢ Virus can live on outer layer of mask for at least 7 days (not tested for more than 7 days, but only very tiny amounts remained at 7 days. Please note that the numbers are in a log scale)

‚Ä¢ Research was done on surgical masks, not for N95 masks, but the two types of masks are made of comparable materials, i.e. non-woven polypropylene.

This implies that a used mask can be placed in a paper bag (please don't use plastic bags, they trap humidity and let the virus survive for longer. See CDC recommendations.) and wait before re-using. This new research by the Lancet suggest that 7 days should be the very minimum of time to wait.

The CDC guidelines for sanitizing and reusing masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html

Other study results: Inactivation on different surfaces:

-printing paper and tissue paper - 3 hours until virus became inactivated

-cloth and wood - no virus on day 2

-smooth surface (glass and bank notes) - no virus on day 4

-stainless steel and plastic - day 7

(A different study put survival on cardboard at 1 day. The different types of fabrics are not studied, but smooth surfaces like waterproof jackets would probably behave more like plastic.)

pH , temperature and cleaning solutions:

-COVID-19 is stable between pH of 3-10 (Vinegar would NOT kill it)

-Virus is undetectable 70C (158F) after 5 minutes. Suggest N95 can be baked (but baking might change the shape, making the seal less effective.) Also undetectable at room temperature 22C (72F) after 14 days, evidence of prolonged stability in the fridge (4C) for weeks.

Effectively killed by 1:49 and 1:99 bleach, ethanol 70%, 7.5% iodine, 0.05% chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine, 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (the stuff that's in some non-alcoholic hand sanitizers). Handsoap solution left passively on a surface also works after a 5 min wait.

The research implies that a fabric mask may actually be quicker to self-disinfect than a surgical mask (<2 days vs >7 days) in the absence of other washing/disinfecting practices. However, the different types of fabrics were not mentioned in this research.

Full original research: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext#section-7c530872-6235-4433-899c-b3f276970189 My apologies to everyone who saw this already, Reddit ate my previous link so I'm re-posting.

Why a bag at all? Why not hang dry the mask? It seems that moving fresh air is more hazardous to the virus than bagging it, so what is the advantage or utility of bagging it at all?

Helps us track which mask has been stored for how long. Hanging would also work and should be faster.

I just wanted to share this with everybody on Reddit... I‚Äôve been having a hard time finding nitrile gloves during Covid-19, but then I realized something 99% of people seem to not think of...

When at Walmart. Go to the AUTOMOTIVE section. I‚Äôve been to 3 local Walmart‚Äôs and each one had 4+ heavy duty ‚Äúgrease monkey‚Äù brand nitrile gloves in size large, for $6.88 each. They‚Äôre near the oil changing supplies at the 3 locations I visited.

Hopefully this helps out some of you guys who have been looking for gloves but unable to find them. Think outside the box, and stay safe out there!

I know this will be buried, and that's probably for the best. I have to get it out.

I work in a nursing home. Today we had our first positive. Staff just walked right out the door when it was announced.

I am a single mother of two, and my kids are on their fourth week of staying with my parents. The only thing in the world I wish is that I was stuck at home with them. Now that half of my department has vanished, I don't know when I will see them again.

I'm scared, I miss my kids, and I just want to walk off a job that has given us everything.

It's an awful situation that no one asked for. It's even worse for those that work in the care sector as now there is more at stake. You have your own Families and also the care of the vulnerable and most likely there will be fatalities there. It's a terrible scenario to be stuck in and I wish you the very best in dealing with whatever decision you make.

Respect is fine, but actually working towards a real change to the working conditions of those 'heroes' and 'essential' workers of our society would be much better. Or just forget about it when it's done and let's fill our pockets with paper again. Our choice and fate.

I live in a place where teachers and nurses are unionized. The key difference being that the teachers have a louder, more powerful union than we do.

And the public backs them everytime they wish to fight for better working conditions or strike. Some of the public even march with them. I know my union did this past strike.

When nurses ask for basic PPE so we can, you know, safely do our jobs, the public says things like "no offense, but you chose this job knowing you'd be dealing with things like this..." I'd like to reach a point where healthcare is as respected as education. Just my opinion.

Maybe a stupid comment but I need some encouragement for my situation. Due to various chronical diseases I am considered being a "Risk patient" regarding Corona even though I'm only in my 20ies. As I live on my own and have no close friends or family here, I need to do grocery shopping and all this kind of stuff by myself. I live in a small town (around 30k people living here) and we have so far around 280 confirmed cases. Now my mom sent me some masks and gloves so I can protect myself while going out but I feel stupid wearing this stuff. I saw people getting angry at others for wearing masks and they got yelled at for "overreacting". Of course I follow the hygiene rules (I did before Corona was a thing already because, you know, hygiene is always important?) and of course I disinfect my car, my door knobs and so on whenever I can but I would feel a bit more safe wearing a mask and gloves. But I don't want get publicly attacked by others for doing so. Yes I know I should care for my own safety but I hate causing trouble just because others are stressed out by seeing people wearing masks. Literally having an identity crisis here for nothing. Anxiety is at its peak due the whole situation.

This
I parked in front of Trader Joes with a mask beside me on the seat. Put it on, felt dumb. Watched people walking in, nobody had masks on. Felt dumb. Took it off and went inside.

Spent the next week regretting the decision. Every little thing I thought was a symptom, "Why didnt I put that mask on?!" I imagined dying because of some foolish feeling of vanity, looking silly, whatever.

You'll spend nights wishing you put it on if you don't. You wont spend nights wishing you never put that mask on. Guaranteed.

Exact same thing for me finally I just bit the bullet and did it and got over that feeling after a few minutes. But I had a week where I was like do I have a fever? Why did I let my stupid pride and what people I don‚Äôt even know thought of me stop me from taking a simple step to protect my and my family‚Äôs lives?

I‚Äôve gone out for groceries twice in the last month, I wore a N95 and bright blue gloves, and I felt like I was sticking out and there was a spotlight on me. I felt crazy at first like I was overreacting because no one else had a mask or gloves. I just kept my eyes to myself and made quick work of it, no problems. The second time, the store was packed like shopping for a holiday and only 4 or 5 other people had masks, but I felt much more confident in my choice. Don‚Äôt let others behavior change what‚Äôs best for YOU.
Two things have really helped my anxiety levels the last number of weeks. One is Bren√© Brown and her podcast Unlocking Us, and guided meditations on stress from the 10% Happier app.
Hope this helps!

You have to build a shell around yourself that says f*** whatever anyone thinks about me. It‚Äôs your life not theirs. You‚Äôre vulnerable and you need to wear this stuff. No ones gonna say anything, make eye contact and stand proud that you‚Äôre not a dipshit. Whenever I‚Äôm out wearing my bandanna, I don‚Äôt have a mask, I feel like I‚Äôm part of the smart ppl club. More and more are joining. Change your perspective to wearing the mask means you‚Äôre part of the cool kids and everyone else is late the party. But they‚Äôll get there and you wearing the mask will encourage them to do the same.

So, this isn‚Äôt about what others think of you, this is about YOU taking care of yourself. I wore a mask and gloves into a store the other day and maybe saw two others and I know folks were looking at me but I really don‚Äôt care. You see these people very briefly, so don‚Äôt care about what they say or think, YOUR HEALTH is most important. If someone says something to you just ignore them and move on, you aren‚Äôt doing anything to bother them, if anything you may be protecting them if you are asymptomatic.

I'm still working (at a credit union) and I'm personally grateful for people who come in with masks (not gloves bc most people who come into my cu don't know how to use them). My husband and I both still work and we've got kids at home and I'm getting terrified more daily, people being cautious helps me feel better. I have friends in grocery and other people-facing essential positions who feel the same. Don't work about other customers, the workers will appreciate you and you will appreciate yourself for being cautious.

Yeah I would recommended getting everything delivered if you can, otherwise doing curbside pick up. If you absolutely must go into a store, you should be wearing a mask as you are a high risk individual. I understand that this is uncomfortable socially but if anything, maybe seeing you wear a mask can convince other people to take this more seriously and potentially save them some grief too in the long run

There's quite a bit of mask wearing in my area, but I think I'm the only one that does it when I take out the garbage. Oh well, I'm going to keep doing it though.

A lot more people are going to wear masks very soon. You might see some on your next grocery trip.

Please wear the mask. Skip the gloves if you have hand sanitizer you can use when you get back in the car and just wash your hands when you get home. I've been wearing a mask for two weeks to protect others from me. At first I was the only one, now I'd say my community is wearing them 75% of the time. Be the person that makes it ok to wear a mask.

I have been out a few times and see a lot of people wearing masks but I don‚Äôt live in a small town. My worry about what others thought disappeared after committing to putting it on and being inside for a minute. I‚Äôd try that and I bet after a few minutes you‚Äôll feel fine. And if some idiot does say something than they‚Äôre just an idiot.

This stoic quote helps me in these types of situations : ‚ÄúWhen you are ready to take some undertaking remind yourself of what the nature of that undertaking is. If you are going out of the house to bathe, put before your mind what happens at a public bath - those who splash you with water, those who jostle against you, those who vilify and rob you. You will set about your undertaking more securely if before beginning , you say to yourself ‚ÄúI want to take a bath and at the same time keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature.‚Äù And do this for every undertaking. For if anything happens to hinder you in your bathing, you will be ready to say, ‚ÄúOh well, this is not the only thing that I wanted, but I also wanted to keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature; and I will not do that if I am annoyed at what is going on.‚Äù

Very busy. My store has restricted the amount of people allowed inside to 50% of store capacity, but since that also includes our large clothing and furniture areas, it has done nothing to ease the grocery crowds. Hopefully after Easter the crowds will lessen.

Way busier than they should be based on current guidelines. Where I live, 98% of people don‚Äôt wear masks and stop to talk to friends in the aisles. My family has minimized trips and tried to have a short list of what was needed before leaving, but it seems like many are just out because they aren‚Äôt sure what else to do.

That being said, the stores are implementing social distancing measures to try to defend against the spread of the virus. Checkout lanes have plexiglass guards, and aisles are marked as one-way through the grocery.

Maybe the difference is location. I'm in a very large city. The stores aren't crowded, although they are far from dead. I don't see people bringing kids or socializing. People wear masks. There's always at least one jerk who doesn't practice distancing (almost like they're doing it for attention), but for the most part people are aware and considerate.

speaking of attention...i go out every two weeks. the first time was mid march and at midnight (before they changed hours) and guys were tossing beach balls around the grocery aisles and loading up on corona beer. beginning of this month we were sold out of various things and people were engaging in socially distant conversation much more than usual (like they were very nice and open about talking, i guess from being stuck inside so much haha). when i go out in a few days i'm curious what the vibe will feel like

It's like everyone is preparing for a blizzard or hurricane every day since the 2nd week of March. Warehouse can't keep up with the demand on anything, so I have the explain to the customers how the supply chain works and that's why we only get a toilet paper shipment once a week. Every day someone throws a fit because a cashier has to let them know they can't buy their 20 packs of meat for their cookout because the limit is 2. Some people wear masks and gloves then throw them outside in the parking lot when they leave. The only time they stand 6 feet apart is when they are next in line to checkout but mash up close to each other past the second 6 foot marker. We are also the only store open around here after 8pm so we get rushes late at night, too. Workers are starting to lose their minds.

Very busy. But stay out of and away from Walmart. They limit to maybe 40 customers in the whole entire store and queue people in one at a time. Everything is empty and shelves ravaged.

And priorities for people are crazy. Last trip there saw a husband and wife with a shopping cart stacked high and full of 12 packs of beers and nothing else. During checkout the man in front of us yesterday bought a dozen bottles of maple syrup and nothing else.

The store I work at hasn‚Äôt restricted entry yet. I stock shelves and people are still coming right up and reaching around me to grab items without a warning/‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù to give me time to move 6 ft away.

No one seems to even be trying to stay 6ft away. If someone‚Äôs being cautious, they‚Äôll stay about 2ft. I think 6 ft is a lot wider radius than people think. I always find myself trying to estimate the distance by counting the linoleum tiles (about 12‚Äù x 12‚Äù) and no one comes close to the social distancing guidelines.

More and more people are wearing masks, but few wear them correctly, and most of my co-workers aren‚Äôt wearing any. (I suspect from lack of access). I have an old N95 from housework that I spray with Lysol after each use. My employer provides gloves and recently got face shields, but no one has been wearing them yet.

Hasn‚Äôt been tooooo busy today but comes in waves.

NY wasn't testing anyone except older population and first responders. I've been waiting for a month for my test. There will be thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of new cases just because they recently opened testing to everyone.

My mom just proudly announced: "look at the material I got to make my own mask.". As she invited over 20 family members over today for Easter. It's difficult to be the educated son with everyone else having blatent disregard for anything I tell them. What do I know. I'm a democrat who listens to CNN (as well as even questioning them on certain things) with a college degree so I must instantly be fooled by the media.

I‚Äôve got a feeling of fear and frustration that I can‚Äôt shake, after a growing number of articles I‚Äôm reading are speaking of recovered coronavirus patients in South Korea and China testing positive for the virus again, after having previously tested negative and losing all symptoms. You can find these articles just Googling for Coronavirus Immunity.

The three explanations that seem most prevalent are as follows.

[Optimistic] Unreliable tests. False negative before when the virus hasn‚Äôt fully cleared out of their system yet. Or false positives now.

[pessimistic] The virus went ‚Äúdormant‚Äù in these people and then ‚Äúreactivated‚Äù somehow.

[doomterror] They are getting reinfected.

I‚Äôm trying to shrug this off because Dr Fauci has said he has a high degree of confidence that those who recovered will be immune at least through the fall, protecting them from any second wave that could happen.

But there‚Äôs just this ebbing feeling of fear because there‚Äôs some reports out there that those who had only mild symptoms aren‚Äôt producing a lot of antibodies. That could mean immunity might only last a few weeks like it does with the common cold. That could mean no vaccine may ever work.

How long do you think it will be before scientists know substantial proven FACTS about this? Because the lack of knowing is driving me to madness. It‚Äôs terrifying. Are these articles just deliberately fear monger in hand misinformation? Is that why they‚Äôre not being widely reported and ignored by the mainstream?

I believe the overwhelming medical consensus/expectation is that true reinfection within the span of even years is extremely unlikely. Also, we already know the virus is like other Coronaviruses and doesn't mutate quickly, like the flu. Folks here are quick to say things like "we don't know yet" which is true. However, I think the news and the doomers are largely misreading these reports. I think, if anything, it's telling us this virus behaves unpredictably and longer periods of isolation are required after recovery "just to be sure."

The Coronavirus has caused the food bank and other support systems to be completrly overwhelmed, and they are in desperate need of aid. With the coming stimulus checks, we have the opportunity to support those in need (for those that do not actually need the stimulus check to survive). Every dollar or donation helps these organizations.

The last 3 Mondays that I've gone to my local food bank they've been rationing out less and less, with the lines getting longer and longer. I'm worried that when I go tomorrow they'll be turning people away because they have run out. Food banks desperately need support more than ever so please donate to them if you can <3

I really hope that your food bank gets the help it needs. I am heartbroken to see all those in need with little being reported on how to help.

Also to anyone reading, the article goes into detail why this is a must but the tl;dr: the food bank accepts both food AND monetary donations. With unprecedented demand for food and increasing food costs they desperately need aid.

You can go to the foodbank website and support the bank as a whole OR a local one. Also to anyone reading: please, if the stimulus check is your lifeline, I am not suggesting you use it. Only those who are able, help those in need.

Fauci says we can very gradually start some re opening next month but it really depends on the area. I think sports are still questionable because an arena or stadium full of people will cause a recurrence of the virus in a given area.

Entertainment will probably be the last thing to open up. Gov Cuomo is saying he can‚Äôt open businesses up without opening schools. If schools stay closed until June then business stay closed until June and he‚Äôs not willing to do that. He said when it‚Äôs appropriate to open up they will be together. He also wants to make a partnered decision with New Jersey, and Connecticut so they have the same restrictions in place.

Not perfectly protective, but drops your chance of catching it dramatically. For best protection from an outside trip, drop the scarf/bandana/t-shirt straight in the washing machine when you get home with the rest of the clothes you wore outside the house. Then have a shower and dress in clean clothes. No need for another shower that day if you‚Äôve left the house and showered as soon as you get back.

In theory, USA should be around the peak or plateau now, though I'm skeptical of that. Last night's numbers are a good sign, though it might just have been the weekend underreporting effect or a bottleneck because of testing. Cross your fingers.

Honestly I‚Äôm so disgusted by our government/hospitals forcing doctors and nurses to work without proper PPE gear. How the f*** did this shit happen?? How hard could it possibly be to just have reusable PPE gear that is sanitized at the end of each health care workers shift? Surely someone could invent this, we have been able to figure out electricity, the internet, how to fly in planes and drive in cars... but not reusable, sanitize-able PPE gear? I don‚Äôt get this at all... these health care workers are being forced to fall on their swords to help people. They are heroes for this, but they deserve to feel safe too. How could this happen in the ‚Äúrichest country on the planet‚Äù: the United States of America??

I purchased a harmonica online today from a harmonica warehouse, i guess, or store that operates online to learn to play while in quarantine, but i didn't think till after i purchased it that what if the store is closed due to lockdown. Are music stores or music warehouses essential businesses? Since the purchase goes through electronically how will I get my harmonica or call the company if they are closed? The website doesn't have anything about covid19 policies. Its harmonicaland.com incase you're wondering.

In a nearby neighborhood today there was a teen charging $7 to go to go by houses dressed as the Easter Bunny. The story was that they‚Äôd stay at the street and wave.

A picture I saw tells a different story where the person in a bunny suit was standing in the doorway with a child hugging her, arms around waist, face up against fur.

The parents defended it that the person used hand sanitizer and wiped the costume with Clorox wipes.

How many other kids did that person come in contact with? How is this ok? I feel like this person broke the law, never mind put people‚Äôs lives at risk.

Infuriating.

I haven't really seen anyone talking about mild symptoms that last for a long time.

I am fairly certain I have had corona, Roughly a week after my symptoms started my housemate also developed different corona symptoms (Headache and high fever plus some vomiting).

I depending upon how you look at it was either less or more lucky. I have not had a fever but had several symptoms that have all been mild. Dry Cough, Shortness of breath, Sharp lung pains, Dull heart pain, Circulation issues and dizziness. I have been fortunate in that none of these symptoms have been severe. However unfortunate in that they have lasted almost a month now with no real improvement. They first started on the 17th of march with just a Dry cough.

I have yet to see anyone describe symptoms like these that last for so long, My main concern is that perhaps Corona has been and gone but kicked off some underlying condition? Note that we are both in our early 20's and otherwise healthy and fit individuals. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this that are mild but long lasting?

i wish they never used the term "mild". the break down that seems to be most common right now is:

75% asymomptomatic or barely noticable

20% "mild" aka worst flu you've had in your life

4% hospitalized

1% dead

or if it excluded the asymptomatic (which were likely not tested anyway yet in the US) you've got 80% mild, 15% hospitalized, 5% dead. all those numbers will shift downward as testing (maybe one day?) becomes more prevalent

Yeah the guy who reported the study said he wished he never used mild. Mild meant did not need ventilator.

didn't know it was an official term from an actual study. i wonder if anyone has made mild ghost pepper salsa as an analogy. i once put 1/8 tsp in a crockpot of chili and burned some folks out. i mean it's mild by comparison though, right?

My girlfriend and I both had these exact symptoms starting around March 11th and they lasted until about a week ago. I‚Äôm not sure we had Coronavirus because we couldn‚Äôt get tested but it was definitely unlike anything we‚Äôve experienced. The good news is we are feeling much better (i still have somewhat of a lingering cough and she gets short of breath easily still when exercising). I would say you probably have what we had (possibly corona who knows). It takes a long time to clear up so just hang in there, we both were wondering at times if it was ever going away. It was interesting you experienced circulation issues, I experienced the exact same thing (arms getting numb or getting tingly randomly) I actually assumed it was some unrelated thing but now I realize it could have been a symptom of the sickness as well. Good luck and stay safe!

Checking in for the day. Just had an egg over hard with some toast, and a cup of coffee.

Was reading that we might have a rolling "reopening" of the USA as early as next month. Hope that means we will have extremely widespread testing by then. Doubtful.

If you‚Äôre talking about the Asian countries spraying the streets. They are most likely using sodium hypochlorite. Cheap, effective, and it neutralizes itself pretty easily. In the first SARS outbreak this is what they also used. As far as actual fuming I‚Äôm not sure what places are doing that.

I keep hearing people say that our lives will never be the same as before this pandemic began. ELI5: Is this true? I mean, a year or two from now, won't we hopefully have a vaccine that everyone will receive each year, much like the flu vaccine, and be able to return to "normal life"?

Flu vaccines aren't 100% effective, and coronavirus is more contagious and more deadly than the flu.

We will eventually return to a more regular lifestyle but I expect masks to remain in common use and society moving towards less physical contact, less handshakes, less kissing acquaintances as greetings in the cultures where it's common now, etc.

Most importantly, we as a global society clearly have to make drastic changes to the way we approach healthcare, social interactions, supply chain, and all the other aspects that the pandemic exposed as wholly broken. Countries with poorer response / higher deaths must learn from the countries with stellar response and less deaths. Going back to the way things were in this respect would be an absolute disaster.

I think for the most part, things will be normal again. There's going to be people with anxiety issues, or other mental health issues that may remain paranoid for longer, and stay shut in, but when things have calmed down, and we've got a vaccine, or at least a decent treatment plan, and outbreaks aren't happening like they are now, I can't wait to get back to restaurants, bars, movie theatres, taking trips, etc.

My brother had a 103 fever, extremely bad sore throat, headaches and a persistent cough for 4 days before the fever broke and he got better. This was a month and a half ago and he tested negative for flu and streptococcus. What other viruses/bacteria could have caused his illness? It seems very unlikely it was coronavirus having had happen in February.

Should I get a mask? People are now saying that it isn't "greedy" and it protects you FROM THE VIRUS. I have been socially isolating for the last 2-3 monthes so I am probably not a carrier, but will this help me not get the virus on my grocery store runs every few weeks?

Most masks aren't going to protect you from the virus. They will protect others from you if you're sick, or asymptomatic. If you've got an N95 mask, AND you've applied it properly, you might have a bit more protection than surgical or home made, but otherwise, you're doing this for others, not yourself.

Masks provide some protection to you, more for the people around you. Even a scarf or bandana wrapped around your nose and mouth is some protection. I've made two at home out of stuff I already had on hand. Lots of instructional videos on how to do it out there. Good luck.

Seems like the best chance of getting back to normal any time soon is if an antiviral is proven to reduce the death rate to flu-like levels or better. Still not as good as a vaccine since you'd still have to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed, but far more realistic in a short time frame.

Genuine question, how come Florida hasn't been affected as badly as the predictions?

Is it an under reporting of numbers? Or that the spread/peak is few weeks behind places like new york?

Or is it likely to not get much worse?

I always assumed the combination of apathy towards the social distancing + their aging boomer population would make it terrible there

I am a nurse that works in the emergency room and have elected to stay in an RV which I began to do yesterday. I am having a really hard time isolating from my kids and husband. I think it's the unknown of how long I'm supposed to stay in here. I usually wake up with my daughter who is five every day laughing and singing which I loved. Tell me isolating is the right thing to do because this is awful.

At some-point people on this planet need to figure out our food problems. Industrial farming, eating endangered wildlife, emptying the oceans its unsustainable. As painful as it may be the only rational option is some sort of man-made protein or lab grown food source. Even mass agriculture is ruining the planet.

From everything I've seen, at least until June. After that there may be smaller cycles of less and more restrictions depending on how many cases there are. I don't think we will get back to "normal" until early next year.

California has extended until at least May 15th. Officially isolation started March 16th. I have many friends who work in hospitals (I know, second hand information here so I realize this is simply IMO) who believe CA will not be re-opened until June at the very earliest.

Other states that are not as stringent, will continue to perpetuate this virus and continue to put us all at risk.

I‚Äôm so sick of all these stupid conspiracy theories and people being too stupid to not understand that this is real, this is happening, and people are dying. I live in North Dakota and we still haven‚Äôt been hit as bad as other states, and their whole argument is ‚Äúdo you even know anybody with it?‚Äù No, I don‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt want to. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening.

I am just so angry! People just don‚Äôt seem to be taking things seriously!

Two clients canceled their online sessions today because ‚Äúthey are having family over‚Äù for Easter dinner / ‚Äúthey are going to their families house‚Äù for Easter dinner.

A close friend of mine who is 6 months pregnant is traveling 4 states south to visit her parents, with her brother and his kid ‚Äî along with her 3 other siblings coming in from different states and all their kids, so they can ‚Äúspend a few days together while they‚Äôre off work‚Äù Essentially there will be 19 people from 7 different households all meeting together to stay for 5 days then go back to their respective homes all from different states. And some of them range from pregnant women, to 90+ year old grandmother, to infant, etc. And when I inquired like ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù She acted like I was crazy, of course it‚Äôs fine, she said, she‚Äôs been going over to ALL of her friends and families houses because ‚Äúit‚Äôs boring just staying home‚Äù.

For over FOUR HOURS the neighbor across the street from us had a HUGE Easter egg hunt yesterday. The entire street was lined with cars! There was at least 20 kids and all of their parents (at least 30+ people) at our neighbors house wondering inside and outside all talking and chatting. Kids running around, playing tag, wrestling around with each other.

Today, the neighbor next to us is having their entire extended family over for Easter dinner ‚Äî there are 9-10 cars in their driveway and parked on the street, with 2-4 people per car.

I know SO MANY PEOPLE that are acting in this way during this crisis. They simply ARE NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING AT ALL!!!!

Look, I may not be happy to but I understand WHY I MUST stay home, not see my family, move all my clients online, take huge income hits by clients that are quitting because I can‚Äôt see them in person. I try to only go out to grocery shop for 1-2x a week at most, I put on gloves and masks and take every possible precaution and only go to the store for food and medications that we can‚Äôt do without.

I don‚Äôt see friends or family; my husband and I stay home all day every day (except the hour or two I go to the grocery store each week). My entire life has been uprooted; we can‚Äôt work, we are worried about money, my husband is furloughed and not being paid, my IVF was canceled the day before it was to take place after a year leading up to it, and on and on. But we have to do all this so that it can end sooner than later! But all these people make it so that it‚Äôs going to last so much longer!! I am so angry about it! Grrrrr!!!!

It is times like this that we see who we can depend on to do the right thing and who should not be trusted with the welfare of others. We like to think that our chosen friends are dependable but how many of them lately have shown themselves to be undeserving of our trust? There are people who I love but who through their own words and actions have made me rethink how close I should allow them to get to me. This crisis has changed the way I view people, for sure.

To those that think we can somehow stop virus without herd immunity I want to throw this out there.

What countries are doing is slowing the spread so hospital infrastructure has a chance to treat the sick. Countries that have successfully halted spread will experience a reemergence since the population has no herd immunity. The virus will be able to spread through an area until about 60% of the population has immunity.

Seems to be a lot of misleading information and unrealistic expectations going through the reddit hive mind. Only one type of opinion is ever posted on this subreddit.....and that opinion seems to think if we lock down long enough somehow the virus will go away.

My understanding is we are simply buying time. We will likely not be able to hold out for a vaccine, but some kind of breakthrough in therapy could be discovered in this time. Meanwhile, yes, we keep our hospitals from collapsing and give us time to ramp up production for adequate PPE to protect them and eventually the rest of us.

Several things need to happen, the most urgent one being we need the healthcare system to be robust enough to handle the extra cases that the opening will bring. We also need to accurately identify those who had the disease and is now immune (antibody studies are underway right now) and those who are not asymptomatic carriers (faster and more accurate testing than what we have now). Those two groups of people could in theory mix safely. However, extensive contact tracing should probably be to be in place so that as soon as one of them develop symptoms we will need to isolate not only them but also people they have been in close contact with a few days prior. China and South Korea were able to do this, several countries are talking about it, I am not sure how the West would be able to do this without massive invasions to privacy but are lot of people are thinking about these problems right now and I'm optimistic that there will be solutions.

I'm sorry if this has been asked, but if you have received your stimulus direct deposit, what time did it arrive in your bank account, if you noticed? Thank you!

I just learned about the Asian Flu of 1957 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957%E2%80%9358_influenza_pandemic and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu

Wow. Pretty terrific. 2 million deaths for the first pandemic, 1 million deaths for the second. In France alone, the Hong Kong flu killed 30k people without medias really picking up the story...

The flu can also be a hardcore disease, causing random deaths amongst youngster in good shape. I'm not a fan of the "it's just the flu" expression: it's a bad disease that can kill you. It has also the right characteristics (like covid-19) to kill millions: spread easily, and doesn't kill too much.

Of course I know Coronavirus is way more dangerous. We may end up with the same death count than these two pandemics, but at the cost of locking down half of humanity at home...

From your sources:

0.3% mortality in the United Kingdom

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957%E2%80%9358_influenza_pandemic

In comparison to other pandemics, the Hong Kong flu yielded a low death rate, with a case-fatality ratio below 0.5% making it a category 2 disease on the Pandemic Severity Index. The pandemic infected an estimated 500,000 Hong Kong residents, 15% of the population.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu



SARS-CoV-2 reality:

What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?

It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the UK‚Äôs chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/what-is-coronavirus-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-covid-19

The new study from China and published on the CDC website suggests the R0 for COVID-19 could be as high as 5.7, meaning the disease is highly contagious. It is unclear if the new study refers only to cases in China or if it can be applied elsewhere.



The R0 for Asian influenza was about 1.8 and 60-65% of infected individuals were estimated to have experienced clinical symptoms.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445311



Estimates of the Transmissibility of the 1968 (Hong Kong) Influenza Pandemic: Evidence of Increased Transmissibility Between Successive Waves

Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) were in the range of 1.06‚Äì2.06 for the first wave and, assuming cross-protection, 1.21‚Äì3.58 in the second.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816729/



R0 is basically how contagious a virus is. The higher the number the more contagious. So coronavirus not only has a higher mortality rate but is also more contagious, meaning more people will get it if there wasn't mitigation efforts, thus leading to more overall deaths than either of those others viruses. Some epidimologists estimate 50-70% of the global population would become infected. Assuming there are 8 billion people and half get infected, with a 1% mortality rate, that's 40 million people dead within the span of a few months.

April 12 Updates

Incorporated April 11 data

Cumulative positive percentage (CPP) increased from 19.5% to 19.6%

Overall trend continues

The plateau in new cases per day (around 30,000) seems to be limited by how many tests are performed.

Simply put, if tests are limited to 150,000 with 20% positives a plateau is hit at 30,000 new cases a day.

The table below shows how this tracks with the last 13 days of US historical data on testing from https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily

The cumulative positive percentage (CPP) is calculated as the most recent Positive / Total Tests (522,843 / 2,665,666 = 19.6%).

Estimated Cases (Est Cases) is calculated as that day's New Tests x CPP.

The daily positive percentage (DPP) is calculated as that day's New Cases / New Tests and shows how consistently these two statistics are related.

This highlights the importance of widespread, large-scale testing. Without it:

New cases appear to plateau leading to a false sense of security

Deaths are undercounted due to undiagnosed cases

Projection models are less accurate (garbage in garbage out)

Hey make a rule preventing people from reposting the same article just worded differently. ‚ÄúIf only we acted sooner‚Äù articles are annoying a‚Äôf to see everyday. WE GET IT WE ARE NOT RETARDED. What is it like the 12th week in a row that people post the same shitty articles just worded differently?

Those posts aren‚Äôt helpful. If you remove posts and comments that are political in nature please remove the retarded ones too. The first few articles were great, but after seeing the 100th one maybe it‚Äôs about time to restrict dumb ass posts

I just want to real quick remind people who need to be reminded that, for people who are susceptible to mental illness, extreme quarantines (like Italy‚Äôs or Spain‚Äôs) are not just an inconvenience, they‚Äôre a major health threat and potentially a larger threat to some people‚Äôs safety than COVID-19.

If you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like have a personal crisis while sitting alone in a safe place, please don‚Äôt claim that quarantines are nothing more than an inconvenience. Mental illnesses can cause people to go off the edge for seemingly no reason because it can spiral out of control so fast.

Can someone please ELI5: What incentives do countries have to lie about COVID-19 related statistics? For example, China claims they only have 3,339 related deaths. China is the most populated country in the world, and has many of the most densely populated areas on earth. They‚Äôre absolutely lying. What do they have to gain?

China might be lying about total numbers, but they most definitely got the spread under control and it‚Äôs not spreading in any meaningful way there. If they hadn‚Äôt, their numbers would now be so high that there would be no way to hide the sick and dying. As you said, their population is huge. They pretty much locked down wuhan and rounded up the cases outside the province.

China isn't much different in this respect than the US right now. Chinese leadership hates criticism and despises anything that makes them look weak or inept. Regardless of reality they want to appear strong and competent.

Note that this doesn't just mean Xi Jinping personally ruling with an iron fist and suppressing dissent. This is driven at lower local levels. Local hospital administrator doesn't want the eye of Sauron on him so he treats patients as 'presumptive positive' that gets the individual patient the exact same care they'd get with a test, but makes the hospital look clean on paper.

This is how it's really driven. People are told to just stay home and see if they improve, their current symptoms are ineligible for testing. People that are eligible get marked 'presumptive positive' treated without getting tested. People that do get tested have their batches backlogged.

This attitude of keeping up appearances over accurate numbers is the real answer to your question, not a giant all-powerful cover-up.

to avoid showing weakness to potential enemies

to save their own tourism industries (think about US states that may be selectively truthful about their numbers)

to make whatever cure or treatment they used appear to the be best

to control their population or avoid insurrection/upheaval

to control the fear of their own people

to keep other countries as trading partners

to begin the process of passing the blame to someone else for being the cause of the virus

China needs to have a good reputation to expand its influence in Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact I‚Äôd say given their strategy of making Sub-Saharan Africa their outsourcing locations by making certain countries in the region think a partnership with China is a good long-term strategy, China is the most likely to lie about their figures.

I called my grandma over facetime to wish her a happy easter.

She had people over. Her sister and husband, and her husband's brother and wife. It's not a lot of people, and I know that her sister doesn't go out, but like... I was kind of annoyed. Esp. because my grandmother is usually really careful about COVID-19. She doesn't go out anymore, she orders her groceries and wash them with soap and water. She washes her hand, and because her husband is still working, they religiously clean his truck with bleach, wear masks and gloves when he comes back, etc.

But she STILL had people over.

And then I just thought about ALL the people that probably met over Easter and I think that is going to be a very spectacular disaster

I have this odd feeling that I might have already had Covid-19.

Back in Late January 29/30 I went on a business trip that involved travel in a major airport. When I got home a day later I was sicker than I have ever been....

Chills so bad I had to shower 4x a day to stop shivering, shortness of breath so bad I needed an inhaler to go upstairs, a 102 fever, and the worst of it came at night where sleep just didn‚Äôt happen. I had been sick before but never like this - I can usually work from home after a day or so, but this knocked me out for 5 days. The doctor confirmed at the very least it was a flu.

Just hearing what folks are saying and personal stories now that we have more information makes me think it might have been....but the timing seems a little early because at the time the US barely had any cases.

If there is antibody testing it would be helpful for people like me to know for sure. It wouldn‚Äôt change my strict commitment to social distancing and cleanliness, but it would take my anxiety down at least 1%, which in this environment would be a huge victory.

I've been reading the US plans to "return to normal" and so far all of them seem to take a national approach. Wouldn't it make more sense to close down state borders and start "clearing" states from least populous/least affected upward? That seems far more manageable. Why isn't this being proposed???

Do you have the same chance of getting coronavirus as any other viral infection?

Oh wow, thanks for the reply. It seems as though looking at those rates, the numbers are around the same as influenza and the common cold, so it seems you have the same chance of getting corona as you do of getting either of those diseases, right?

It's around those numbers yes, keep in mind small changes in r0 can make a big difference overall in a population of people.

Imo, I think it's great that people wear masks and gloves or whatever ppe they want but if they follow social distancing, try their best to stay 6ft away and wash hands regularly then all the ppe is just trying to control a slim margin of risk.

And of course the risk of actually dying is a separate thing so you have the risk of catching it multiplied by the risk of dying and you end up with an overall pretty low amount of risk.

UK I work for a bank so I‚Äôm classed as a key worker I was sent home for 2 weeks because I had symptoms, I should have been back last Tuesday but because of holidays and Easter I‚Äôm not back in until Tuesday.

The symptoms (fever and cough) stopped about a week ago but now I‚Äôve noticed today the symptoms are coming back. The advice I received from 111 was just to use over the counter medication and hope it gets better. Getting a bit worried about it since I‚Äôm due back on Tuesday and I‚Äôve already had my 14 days self isolation, what can I do next?

Ok y'all! Anyone else have a cold for like a month?!

I had a slight runny nose early March, transformed into a mild bronchitis as quarantine ramped up (probably due stress) and now it's early April and I still have a bit of phlegm. No fever or anything particularly concerning, just a feeling of run-downness.

I'm operating on the assumption that I'm infectious and not going out to the grocery store or anything like that. But how tf would you know it's not Covid, and it's just a cold? Is it worth calling my doctor up over?

No. I never had a cold that lasted that long. And I think that you need antibiotics for bronchitis. Without them, it will never go away.

I've been sick since November in all honestly. Get something, it would last weeks, two week repreave, and repeat. Daughter just so happened to start two day preschool in September. It's the most I've been sick in years. We always take extra precaution this time of the year as well, but toddlers are germ fests.

[US] So it looks like the pospects of a total lockdown (where people cannot go outside their own homes) is never going to happen here. Can we start eating into our 2-week stockpile of food? I just dont want to bother going to the supermarket having to wear a mask.

What kinda helps me is put mask on first, then sit glasses on. It does not 100% work, but I've noticed it alot less unless I am breathing hard. Glasses definitely sit weirdly though. It feels like I moved my glasses down my nose to use my bifocals. Like what you see in cartoons or movies. It makes you wanna move them a lot though, but you can use your arm, basically your shoulder, to push one side up at a time.

Hey! I used to use anti-fog spray when I wore my neck warmer. 'Quick spit' spray worked quite well, otherwise I also tried to get into the habit of not having my glasses pushed up against my face, allowing the area to have good air flow. It's a hard habit to get out of but you don't get fogged up as badly.

edit: I should mention I do wear a mask but as I haven't actually gone outside I haven't needed to wear one yet!

hypothetically let‚Äôs say most countries lift their lockdown by june. Do you reckon we could have a second wave of covid19 cases and a whole load more deaths? and if so is there any way we could prevent a second wave of cases

If you lift the lockdowns, you need to be able to do 3 things to keep a second wave of cases low:

point of origin diagnostic testing. This means, local doctors able to test a patient for covid-19 and get results back quickly.

Quick and efficient serological testing. This means, the ability to see if someone has already had the disease and has antibodies for it. This helps prevent health care workers from being quarantined for no reason.

Efficient contact tracing of patients who test positive for covid-19. This way you can have people who have had contact with an infected person self-quarantine until they have been tested for the virus.

My mental health is declining. Been getting migraines again (related to stress). I'm sleeping well enough but almost everyone around me is increasing my stress. At my last corporate job the stress was super high. I am more stressed out now. When the gym was open I was able to channel out all the stress but now with no gym it's getting bottled up. I can go out for a jog or go on my treadmill if I want to workout. But it's not the same. I am mentally and emotionally exhausted today. Being at home for so long with nothing to do (basically I got laid off) is killing me inside.

If you are in a high infection zone, I would be more cautious and not take unnecessary trips.

If you are in an area with low infection just follow recommended distancing and hygiene procedures. Wash hands, don‚Äôt touch your face, etc.

Going to share an anti-mask e-mail my mother received. It makes such claims as

"Wearing a mask while healthy might actually make you sick"

"It becomes an ideal place for virus and bacteria to thrive"

"There's no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them"

"Suicides are outpacing coronavirus deaths. 'Thus far, our reaction to COVID-19 has been to

sacrifice the global economy,' Jacobs said. 'The truth is: a sick economy produces sick people.'‚Äù

Seriously, just check out the full thing. Mind boggling:

Hey guys,

Alright so prepare, because this is an extremely dumb question...I needed humidifiers because I have extremely dry sinuses. None in my local stores, so I ordered one of Amazon and it arrived in like 2 days (unbelievably). Of course I left it in the garage for about 22 hours and wiped the boxes down. Finally I got to the humidifier and immediately used it, as I was breathing in the steam, the paranoia filled thought dawned on me, I didn‚Äôt disinfect the humidifier, so if someone coughed in it or the virus got in I totally just inhaled via mist. Is that even possible?!? I‚Äôm laughing at myself while typing this tbh but the mist is cool/cold and it only took 2 days to reach me...which isn‚Äôt enough for the virus to die on a plastic surface. Like I said, weird question but this virus has me on edge. Thanks!

How long do you think this machine was on its way from some cheap ass China manufacturers to the country you live? You got to figure by ocean transport so maybe a month? Maybe two? Coz sure as hell they ain't gonna charter planes to get this humidifier to your lazy mail order ##s asap. Then it probably stood in some Amazon warehouse for weeks? So my guess is that it's been in the packaging for more then 3 days untouched by human hands... Which is likely anyways because it probably is assembled by some knock off Japanese robot anyways.

The humidifier was in a box or had some sort of packaging, no? Presumably it's been packaged and sitting in a warehouse for quite some time before it was put inside the shipping box and sent to you, no?

Is it me or is the US vastly under reporting resolved cases?

If you look at any country's resolved cases they are somewhat consistent with total case numbers from ~2 weeks ago.

The US, on the hand, had almost 3x the confirmed cases on 3/30 as it has resolved cases on 4/13

Country	Resolved Cases	Cases (3/30)	Ratio
Italy	54,110	101,739	1.88
Spain	82,216	87,956	1.07
Germany	67,322	66,885	0.99
Belgium	10,610	11,899	1.12
Canada	7,889	7,448	0.94
S. Korea	7,664	9,661	1.26
USA	55,749	165,053	2.96
Why the hell are the US resolved cases 1/3rd of the total cases 2 weeks ago? It's out of line with what is happening everywhere else

I get that none of the numbers are perfect but this seems wildly inaccurate

The U.S. is NOT vastly under reporting deaths. The resolved cases is a very poorly kept statistic and shouldn't even be included in any counts. I don't know why they continue to report that number.

I want to know if ticks can spread Coronavirus, as I live in the middle of Lyme Disease country. I've ready that Lyme Disease occurs when deer ticks infect small mammals and birds, and then bite us humans. I don't know if Coronavirus can or does affect other animals species, so I'm wondering if ticks that have invaded animals which, hypothetically, have contracted COVID-19, and then bite us, can infect us with COVID-19 to us in this sort of indirect fashion.

I can't comment on if ticks can spread COVID, but Lyme disease can wreck you pretty hard and should probably be your primary concern. Be diligent about searching for and removing ticks. Keep note of bite marks and call your doctor if you see a "bullseye" or "target" rash appear.

Unlikely but possible. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, its efficiency and power comes from being transferred via breathing. You are are exponentially more at risk from one person you may come in contact with around you than you are from all the ticks in the world put together.

A small study in Brazil was halted early for safety reasons after coronavirus patients taking a higher dose of chloroquine developed irregular heart rates that increased their risk of a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia.

Chloroquine is closely related to the more widely used drug hydroxychloroquine. President Trump has enthusiastically promoted them as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus despite little evidence that they work, and despite concerns from some of his top health officials. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency approval to allow hospitals to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile if clinical trials were not feasible. Companies that manufacture both drugs are ramping up production.

The Brazilian study involved 81 hospitalized patients in the city of Manaus and was sponsored by the Brazilian state of Amazonas. It was posted on Saturday at medRxiv, an online server for medical articles, before undergoing peer review by other researchers. Because Brazil‚Äôs national guidelines recommend the use of chloroquine in coronavirus patients, the researchers said including a placebo in their trial ‚Äî considered the best way to evaluate a drug ‚Äî was an ‚Äúimpossibility.‚Äù

Despite its limitations, infectious disease doctors and drug safety experts said the study provided further evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are both used to treat malaria, can pose significant harm to some patients, specifically the risk of a fatal heart arrhythmia. Patients in the trial were also given the antibiotic azithromycin, which carries the same heart risk. Hospitals in the United States are also using azithromycin to treat coronavirus patients, often in combination with hydroxychloroquine.

I created this website to help people on the front lines and to help increase social distancing- tp-report.com

Send it to anyone you know working at a grocery or supermarket or store so they can make a report. Check it to see if a place has toilet paper in stock.

It was super fun to build. I hope people use it.

I learned a lot. For the front end I used React, React hooks/redux, Apollo/GraphQL, Material Ui, and custom CSS. For the back end I used NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, Mongo DB Atlas, and GraphQL.

Please read this article about European countries re-opening. Before you attack Sweden's response, note that Denmark never went into a "full lockdown" (i.e. many shops remained open, outdoor movement freely allowed unlike Italy and France). https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52226763#

This suggests that "extreme lockdowns" may be of less value than we originally thought.

Is it okay that Italy and Spain and France imposed these? I guess so.

May we ultimately learn that they were too aggressive and not entirely necessary? It's possible.

Something tells me than 20K deaths and rising will never qualify for 'too aggressive'.

Less aggressive measures earlier on would have done a better job, sure, but no future hindsight will possibly render US response as anything other than insufficient.

From a medical standpoint sure, from a governmental standpoint I think telling people they can‚Äôt go for a walk outside is an unacceptable level of authoritarianism, businesses closing is reasonable but you can‚Äôt just confine people in their homes as a government and expect your credibility with the electorate to be unaffected. They‚Äôre going to remember when their government threatened civil or criminal penalties if they needed to go out and get some fresh air.

Some people, such as myself, are more introverted and thus able to handle a solitary lifestyle with more equanimity. Also, Living in Alaska, we just have a lot fewer people, and that helps in the sense you can get outside without feeling like you are in danger, or a danger to others.

I understand your point of view, however, since my wife and son are social people and this is getting tough for them.

I suspect that people who are normally very well adjusted have fewer tools in their kits to cope with something like this, just due to lack of experience. Everyone cope differently, I obsessively read all Covid related research, my girlfriend shut out all news, and my boyfriend plays a lot of games. You can try lots of different things until you find the coping mechanisms that would work for you, it's ok to fall apart sometimes, that is one of the tools in the kit. You will get there, you didn't become an engineer over a few weeks, this too will take time and effort.

I consider myself an introvert, but the things I do enjoy have all gone away during this (sports, casinos, theme parks). I had never realized how much I mentally relied on coming home from work and watching a game or a YouTube video about an upcoming trip.

Obviously I understand there are people/families who are having a much harder time than me, but my mental health has really gone down the drain. I‚Äôm way more anxious, to the point where I‚Äôve considered finding a therapist because I‚Äôve never felt like this before.

So this really seems to spread in big cities. I know the populations are higher in places like NYC, but I had an idea.

In NYC, where you have so many people packed into a small area, and so many buildings clustered together probably making air flow a bit restricted, I wonder if there is a miasma of Covid19? We've learned that it can spread in the air through even just talking. I wonder if as it spreads through the city it is basically polluting the air?

Farfetched I know but there must be some reason why NYC just keeps getting worse and worse.

New York apartment buildings have oversized furnaces specifically so they can keep windows open in the winter.

This seems extremely wasteful and a perennial complaint of apartment dwellers.

The interesting bit is they are oversized because the specs come from the 1918 flu epidemic....

Miasma theory was very popular at the end of the 19th century because the air was foul. It would be ironic if miasma theory beat out germ theory.

My mother has posted a statement on Facebook addressed to not only local residents of my own town, but everyone in the UK and other countries affected by the coronavirus. I have a grandma who unfortunately is at a very high risk level, as I'm sure are many other members of families around the globe. Awareness is key, and if this message gets to anyone who may be endangering people at risk by not taking the necessary precautions, please heed the advice. My mother's message is as follows:



My Mum sent me a message yesterday to say she had seen that toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and masks were stolen from a hospital. She said how disgusted she was by the behaviour of some people who are so greedy and just looking out for themselves and their nearest. She said that she did not ever remember this behaviour happening during the war years. Has our behaviour changed or did it happen and people then did not know about it? She was talking about isolation and how Anne Frank and her family had to stay in a small room for 742 days. This is not the first time in history that this sort of isolation has happened - just a different enemy. My Mum‚Äôs message to these people is that they should be ashamed of themselves but she quite rightly thinks that they just don‚Äôt care. I have even noticed the selfishness on the roads recently. People are driving recklessly - it seems that everyone is tearing around trying to do what they can before they can‚Äôt get out. I tried to go out for a short walk with her yesterday in [home town] in the hope that people would see her and keep their distance. But people are too busy going about their own business to watch out for her and we had to keep turning around to walk the other way so that she didn‚Äôt come into contact with anyone. It was so stressful I won‚Äôt try this again. We have to look after ourselves but others too. My Mum is 89 years old. I am so proud of her and her resilience. I took seeing her for granted and did not ever think that we would not be able to see our elderly parents and friends except over Skype or through a window. My biggest wish for Mother‚Äôs Day is that I could take my Mum to see some Spring flowers somewhere and to give her a big hug and hold her for a very long time but that is just not possible so that will be my wish for when this horrible virus is beaten. I am thinking of everyone who would like to do the same tomorrow. [mum], I am very proud of you and I hope that something good comes out of this terrible situation in the long run. I hope that we respect nature more and to look after our world, I hope that we become less greedy and that we pull together as communities and look out for each other they way my Mum remembers it during the war years.



Please look out for others, be thoughtful and most of all, stay safe.

Seriously need advise. How to deal with people singing karaoke right outside my window? I‚Äôm stuck at home and they‚Äôre not socially distancing.

Update: called the non-emergency police line and they advise me to call 911 and report large gathering and loud music.

5-6 random dudes have been gathering out in the street in front of my apartment building for a couple of days. At first they appear to just be chilling, talking to each other. Since yesterday it escalated to playing music out loud. My entire street can hear it with windows shut.

Yelling at them didn‚Äôt work. They only changed the song. I can‚Äôt call the police either (not life threatening situation).

My grandma said that the coronavirus is being blamed for a lot of other deaths in the U.S., and that's why the death rate is so high. Cuz some professional science guys on Fox news said that whenever someone dies in a hospital for any reason, the doctors are told to say they died from corona. Is this true? I can't find a source online that proves or disproves this. And "Fox news isn't reliable" isnt really an argument, even though I agree with that statement.

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone. Sorry I didn't get a chance to reply.

It‚Äôs much more likely COVID19 cases and deaths are bring underreported. I very much doubt that any hospitals in the US that are dealing with this are lying on death certificates to make this look worse than it is. That‚Äôs a crazy conspiracy theory. I‚Äôd just play along, as long as she isn‚Äôt hurting anyone let her keep believing the crazy.

I just really need to write some s**t somewhere about everything going on in my head. I hope I found the right place...and I apologise if you end up reading this sorry attempt at feeling pity for myself.

I am so scared. I am scared because I am not in control of my life anymore.. Not even as poorly as I was before this even started. It's so ironic since back then, when the world was normal, I used to think everything is so chaotic and used to feel like I should get a grip... Haha, look at me now hitting myself in the head and going insane because I have to stay put and just let people do their job and risk their lives for me. And like the selfish useless s**t that I am, I can't even do that without feeling like my life is over.

I am so scared that my over 65 y.o. mother will have to go back to teaching soon in an enclosed space with hundreds of students. I am scared because she smokes and has hypertension and depression and would surely.... I can't even say it out loud.

I am scared that I don't even understand this. Should I keep masks for a week and wear them afterwards? Should I put them in the microwave for sterilisation? Or in the oven? Does the high temperature render them useless? I don't know. I don't know anything and the more I read the less I know, just like everybody else.

I don't know if it will ever go away. I don't know why people seem to get reinfected. Are the tests bad? Are they not developing enough immunity? Is the virus going through a latency stage like herpes or HIV? It shouldn't, in theory, but do we KNOW?!

I am scared that I will lose it. I had a very bad year from the start, went through one of the hardest things in my life and was at the lowest point ever (ironic, coming from someone who underwent ssri & benzodiazepine treatment for depression and anxiety some time ago). This is a blessing and a curse. It's not letting me process and think about the other things because it's giving me new material to worry and obsess about daily. Ha! :|

I am so ashamed that I wrote so much about myself. I reread this and it's only "I, I, I..." So many people are risking their lives and nobody really knows much and I feel very much like a piece of s**t for this rant because I am very much aware of the privilege of being able to stay home with my family at this time.

L. E. If you actually read my stupid rant, than I'll leave you with this - I don't seem to know anything concrete about this, but I DO know that people have always found ways of handling, solving or dealing with every obstacle. Or, at least that's what I tell myself when I try to calm down... Until then, please stay safe.

Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. Dumping this here is a pretty good coping strategy. try taking media and online breaks and changing your surroundings if you can, even walking in your house can be beneficial. It‚Äôs normal to be scared. The trick is staying functional, and the fact that you‚Äôre able to post is a good sign. Reach out for help via telehealth if you need to.

Be as productive as possible, listen to music you love, spend time on a favorite hobby, catch up with old friends, read, write, learn something new, play an instrument, expand your faith, exercise, stay busy and keep your brain engaged. Focus on actions you can control and don‚Äôt allow your brain to dwell on things that are out of your control.

Acknowledge fear, but do not let it control your every thought.

It is totally OK to feel the way you do, the world is a terrifying and uncertain place right now, you are allowed to try to cope in whatever way you find, and if you need to fall apart sometimes that is OK too, lots and lots of people do. Talk about your emotions is OK, there is no set guide to how you should and should not feel because no one has navigated something like this before. Just because some people have it worse than you does not make your suffering any less real or important. I hope you'll find strategies that work for you and get through this, there will be more answers to your questions soon even if it will not seem that way at first.

Find a psychologist/psychiatrist. They do telemedicine. They will be the ones who can help you through this. It's clear you need some way to express your fears and frustrations and we're not equipped as a bunch of online Internet shitposters to help you.

It sounds like this whole crisis has exacerbated something that's been brewing in your head - that's something only a therapist will be able to help you figure out.

Sorry to hear you say that. I know the struggle when I was younger. My brain didn't work right and I self medicated with a lot of alcohol.

I know you won't like to hear this because if you have no energy you can't do it, but if you can somehow start a very light low intensity exercise goal it will help you. Go slow. Like, Monday, do some pushups. Tuesday, do some squats. Maybe check out some bodyweight. You don't have to do a lot. Get a piece of paper, mark out the day and those 10 little squats. Do it again in two days. Until it's a routine like brushing your teeth.

Speaking of brushing your teeth. Take care of your body as if you were helping someone else. I am sure you can provide good advice to a friend. So pretend you are your friend.

Fair point, I think there is a fair amount of introverts on reddit that are perfectly fine staying at home for long periods.

That is why the lockdowns won't last that much longer. I really think we can see May opening things up.

I shared a pretty detailed post about this a few days ago, but I grew up very introverted. But for the last few years, I've been regretting a lot of past decisions and feel like I've missed out on so much and I'm now seeing that this life I may have dreamed of when I was younger is not the life I want to live. So honestly, I think I'm learning that I'm not quite the introvert I thought I was

I think it will depend on the country but I just don‚Äôt think it will be a normal tourist experience by then but I agree with the other guy and say wait till May, if you need to change I‚Äôm sure you can

You might be able to make it in June, better chance if it is late June.

I don't think countries will still be shut down by then, but there might be some travel restrictions still up.

Countries might be open, but the virus will still be around. One thing is for sure that you won't see the best of Europe this year as everyone will be really sketchy and things won't be fully open.

If it's a once in a lifetime thing for you then it might be worth thinking about what circumstance you want to see Europe so you can make the best of it.

September is when most countries like Spain, France and Germany expect to open up for tourism again. Most commercial flights cancelled till 14th of June already but that will easily extend onto July. I have lots of trips planned from now till August and sadly all going to be rearranged till next summer.

Immune, most likely. There have been reports of people that were 'cured' (negative test result, discharged from hospital) and later tested positive again, but these reports are very rare and probably due to improper testing / faulty test kits.

Back to normal life, not at all. Right now all stay-at-home orders and other restrictions do not make a distinction between people who are immune and those who are not. And I wouldn't count on it changing anytime soon.

All I see on this sub is ‚ÄúWe need to go on strike,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rich need to be taxed,‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople need to vote,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmployees need to pay more,‚Äù etc, etc. Would all of that be great? Yes! But is it realistic? No. This country is extremely corrupted, and the US has sadly become a dog eats dog country. The best anyone can do is care for themselves; save up, get useful skills that will lead to a decent paying job and not a service position, use protection, and don‚Äôt have kids or other things that‚Äôll be unaffordable/hold you back in a crisis.

Unfortunate that you're speaking logic and truth and getting downvoted. If you haven't learned from the Federal Government's response that you are on your own and ultimately nothing more than a resource for the stock market, I don't know what will.

I'm not sure if you're trolling, or being serious, but dude, it's been one month. I understand that it's not ideal that we're staying home, but there are plenty of options for staying sane. Go outside for a walk, or a run, or get on a bike and ride around for a bit. Walk to the grocery store when you have to go, walk home. Facetime with friends. Learn how to do something new, like speak/read a new language, or learn how to write code. Learn how to cook new things. Catch up on some movies, or TV, or play some video games. Facetime with friends & family.

If you're struggling with mental health issues, speak to someone. There are telehealth services available, or even places on reddit where you can find a friend to chat/pen pal while we're stuck doing this. This... isn't ideal. None of us are loving it, but we're doing it because it must be done. Try to make the most of it. Simply giving up isn't going to help you, or anyone else.

june 1 probably works, may 1 probably doesn't. next week in texas doesn't work.

my rough suggestion would be to do a series of polls: ask every hospital administrator in the country if they have enough supplies, equipment, and manpower. anyone who says no, send them what they need. when the daily answer is that greater than 90% have what they need, this poll is complete. ask every city/county if their police, fire and emt has what they need, keep polling until 90% have it. once that's complete you can probably reopen.

during the time when hospitals can look at a calculator and calendar and say "no i don't have what i need if the current rate keeps going" , we shouldn't open up. but once everyone has what they need then they can start thinking about whether to open

There may be small openings here and there in May with added precautions, like mandatory temp taking before entry, or certification of a previous positive and recovery, or alternate accommodations, spaced out seating, less guests, more businesses being allowed to serve their customers under alternate circumstances, etc. Then as there is more and more of this, maybe things get bad again, and certain places have to shut down. I'm not sure there will be any large group events or gatherings though until...???... maybe until a vaccine? Idk. Sports, concerts, conventions, trade shows, etc. these may all have to wait, or be handled very very differently for quite a long time.

What do you all think about churches as an essential service? Looking for real opinions and reasoning, not hate, thanks!

Edit: Not sure why the downvotes, there is some legitimate consideration to consider churches as essential to due the therapy they provide to some people. At the same time, just like therapists have moved online, so can churches to provide their therapy remotely. We just need to make sure people that don't know how to interact with modern technology are taught the basics and have easy access to it. Mental health is just as important as physical health.

And if you're wondering about my bias, I'm not religious. I've been to church a handful of times, mostly as a kid. My focus in college was biochemistry and chemical engineering. I just see the therapeutic benefits church provides to some people.

Edit 2: Again coming from a non religious person, it's a shame to see other non religious people not even being able to empathize with people that truly benefit from the therapy churches provide. No, you going out to drink a beer is not the same therapy as some of these people get in church. It's also pretty petty that you quickly assume my stance on churches being physically open during a pandemic, downvote, and then reply with an insincere holier than thou response. Seriously, think outside your own little bubble.

I'm not religious, but I understand what you've said in responses to others, that it can be therapeutic for some. You know what's therapeutic for me? Going to bars and having drinks with my friends. But I can't do that, and I don't think people should be gathering at church either. The sense of community or connection they get from it can be replicated online in the same way that instead of meeting my friends at a bar or restaurant, we meet up on zoom.

I don't see any reason for an exception.

I see 0 reason they should be included as essential and they also generally involve physical contact. They should be shut down. That said there's lots of businesses also remaining open that shouldn't.

I think there are few things that are essential services: eucharist, christening, wedding and funeral all with less than five people present. Everything else can be done remotely.

Can you people stop being disgusting at grocery stores?

Grocery store employees at working on the front lines of this pandemic. The behavior of customers is disgusting.

Imagine being a grown adult, yet children in Japan and Korea are more behaved than you.



for f***s sake pick up your own garbage and return carts where they belong. Stop litering and leaving gloves and masks everywhere. Either take your garbage with you or PUT IT IN THE TRASH BIN.



I'm working at Walmart and I'm sick of dealing with you subhuman garbage. I'm glad Corona is removing some of you to be honest

Yeah it's this entitled my time is more important than another person's time bullshit. In Japan the kids take turns to clean the school. In the USA, we have kids like Stephen Miller say things like "Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?!"

You're telling me the USA which has a population of 328 million has had more COVID-19 cases, 564,493 cases, than China which has a population of 1.393 BILLION, but only 82,160 cases? Nobody can honestly be buying this, but I'm not hearing anything from any of the media (Infowars doesn't count). You'd think someone would be demanding answers. This thing started in their country, but somehow managed to get out and infest more Western countries than the point of origin?

I'm not saying China's numbers are accurate, but their highly authoritarian society was able to do far more effective lockdowns and tracking of citizens than we could ever do in the US, which DID help them control the outbreak.

1.4 billion X 50% infected X 1% mortality rate = 7 million dead

First case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was discovered in November 2019. China locked down Wuhan and other Hubei province cities on January 23rd, 2020. That's almost 3 months where the virus spread freely in the densely populated city of Wuhan. To compare, New York City has the highest population density in the US, slightly over 10,000 people per square kilometer. Wuhan's central districts range from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. Wuhan's overall population is right over 11 million, NYC is around 8.5 million.

So imagine if SARS-CoV-2 had completely free reign, no social distancing, no lockdowns for almost 3 months in NYC. New York state alone has 3 times more deaths than all of China and the virus only had a few weeks free reign in NY.

Yeah China did an extremely strict lockdown but it was wayyyyy too late. A lot more people than 3,000 died in China, easily. The numbers are obviously false, that's why many if not most governments are questioning them now.

Based on the number of urns pickups (the Chinese government did not release the ashes until recently, for fear of funeral related problems), most Chinese bloggers I follow put the estimated death in Wuhan closer to 60k, so even if you account for a lot of extra non-covid deaths during the lockdown, the government number is off by at least 10x. To be fair, they always said those were the confirmed cases, because no one is sure how many died before testing became available, and the government refuse to count or estimate. It's not nessecarily deliberately false, many other countries have since done the same thing, but with China it will likely be decades before they release an official estimate.

Thought about posting this as it's own thread but want to respect this sub's rules...

Serious question - what is causing the seemingly massive outbreak in New York as compared to not only the rest of the USA, but also the rest of the world?

Currently New York state leads the US in both confirmed cases and deaths, and they have more confirmed cases than ANY OTHER COUNTRY in the world (outside of the USA).

I know there has been some media attention on the amount of testing they're doing, so is it just a case that they're testing considerably more people than other states? Or are their numbers somehow being artificially inflated?

For reference, I'm using numbers from http://www.ncov2019.live

tight quarters and better testing than a lot of places. if you look at a map of cases per 100k (proportionally) in the us the places that have the highest population density are the ones in the worst shape (except for a few small areas that got huge outbreaks). even after they shut down NYC people still had to use public transport at times and still had lots of people around when they shopped, etc

NYC is one of the worst possible cities to be in in a pandemic, it would be much more of a surprise if it didn‚Äôt become the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA. Whenever a pandemic happens, NYC officials have to respond 100% perfectly or NYC will basically automatically become the epicenter of the outbreak.

Patient zero was found to have contracted the virus in Mid November 2019. Smart people, especially Bill Gates, have been screaming at the top of their lungs about a situation exactly like what we're facing right now, people haven't been listening until it's well too late, like usual.

Are cats the new rats? I know that question can upset a lot of folks, but I‚Äôve read that cats can get the virus, and cats sneeze. Also cats get fleas, and can fleas transfer the virus to humans? I‚Äôm asking because a vaccine would then need to be worked on for domestic cats, also feral cats would need to be dealt with.

I‚Äôd first heard about a big cat at a zoo tested positive and since then I saw an article about domestic cats also being susceptible to the virus. Oddly, the wet market in China could sell cat, and that might have been the original source.

If you have an outdoor cat in a densely populated area then tell your cat to socially distance and make them a mask to wear out in public when they get together with all their dirty cat friends.

No. Because each country has a different testing protocol. If we were testing and finding every case, these numbers would have value. I have no reason to believe we‚Äôre counting every positive case. And those who die in their homes without going to the hospital are not being counted as COVID deaths, at least that was the procedure. I don‚Äôt know if it still is.

Except that post is complete horse shit. Nobody is faking how bad things are. Doctors and nurses working in New York will tell you first hand. They're doing so regularly. Who's violating freedom of religion? Which government organization is persecuting people for their religion?

The only point even remotely close in that post is freedom of assembly, but even still, not quite. Here's the definition of freedom of assembly:

Freedom of assembly is the individual right to peacefully assemble, collectively express, and petition the government for redress of grievances guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.

Not quite going to church. What's happening right now is unprecedented and couldn't really have been imagined when the constitution was written. Also, what's being asked of Americans is being asked of people all over the world. Trump, the literal head of the government wants to end this shit asap, get people back to work and do anything possible to increase his chances of re-election. You don't think he wants to be running those rallies of his non stop right now?

This isn't some grand conspiracy. We're in the middle of a pandemic. We're at the start of it. We're doing what we can to limit its damage. This shit isn't hard to understand, but to a very concerning amount of people, EVERYTHING is really something else.. something terrible.. something secret.. something nefarious. Good god, it's exhausting.

Some helpful advice from my long-term psychologist-

Whenever you have a situation with tons of different outcomes based on a lot of variables, it‚Äôs usually safe to rule out both the absolute best and absolute worst outcomes, as it‚Äôs extremely unlikely that all the variables will swing entirely in one direction or the other.

So if we end lockdowns today this won‚Äôt be gone in a week. However, this is also not going to collapse our healthcare system and leave us with a 10%+ fatality rate.

Well...the problem is that we have to be very careful with the level of measures we do take, because while it's possible and even likely that well equipped and more spread out places won't be overwhelmed, we have plenty of evidence from Italy, Spain, UK and especially NYC that extremely densely populated areas are going to have enough spread to overwhelm hospitals.

I wrote a summary about this yesterday, my uncle just left Wuhan and this is based on what he said and some reports from several websites, please let me know if you would like to see links. r/Coronavirus/comments/fxssfx/comment/fmwrkn5

Basically you need to test negative or cleared quarantine to get a Code Green on your cellphone, and you cannot go anywhere without one. Physical distancing and masking is mandatory everywhere and violation is punishable by fines. Most shops are open, crowds are banned. People are trying to live their lives within those constraints

Very true. But some of California's farmers have literally left vegetables to rot because they don't have anyone to pick them. Milk and egg farms have also been hit hard. I remember hearing about one farmer throwing away something of 56k gallons of milk because he didn't have any consumers at the time.

No one knows yet because we don't know how many are infected, until we know how many are infected compared to how many have died it's a guess. You can look at CFR but it's not accurate because it's dependant on how much and what kind of testing a country does.

Tbh it‚Äôs too early to know. Other viral infections involving the heart (eg coxsackie myocarditis) can very markedly impair function but then improve over several months. Many recover completely, some do not.

Can someone with deeper understanding of the supply chain offer some insight into what we can expect on the toilet paper / paper towel / cleaning supplies shortage?

My understanding is that both demand and consumption is up for cleaning goods except for toilet paper. A lot of households have a year's supply of toilet paper and won't need to buy any more for a while, but at the same time they're going through their paper towels and Lysol and Clorox and hand sanitizer at a higher rate than before.

So is it reasonable to assume that toilet paper will become available sooner, while cleaning supply shortages will continue to get worse?

This is geared towards any medical professionals as a serious question. I work with, but am not a medical professional.

I'm currently watching a briefing video/QA on Covid-19 mandated by my company that deals with air medical transport. The Chief Medical Director informing us essentially thinks this is a joke perpetuated from social media fearmongering.

Rough quote from medical adviser: "Are you scared of the common cold, because that is what this is. All of the precautions we are taking overkill. If you aren't 80+ and smoke 3 packs a day, you have nothing to worry about. We joke that influenza season will be shorter because people are actually washing their hands. We will all get it and it won't be a big deal in a month."

This was recorded beginning of March.

To other medical professionals, is this sentiment echoed? This briefing seemed both unprofessional and not relevant with what's happening in April. What are they telling you guys?

Herpes is notorious for giving false negatives. It‚Äôs also possible for some people to be in an infectious period without painful symptoms. Most people aren‚Äôt like that, but a few unfortunate families are genetic carriers of a cluster of skin conditions. Some members have active (Garriers? Derriars? I can never remember the name of it, it involves a calcium malfunction). Their descendants who don‚Äôt have the calcium skin condition are unable to make antibodies to suppress Herpes.

There‚Äôs a few STDs that are frequently asymptomatic in men and sometimes in women that nonetheless lead to female infertility. Chlamydia for one. Genital wart virus is often asymptomatic but can lead to cervical cancer in the long run.

Can't we just make a live attenuated vaccine and inject it in everyone who is healthy?

I understand there is risk with injecting live weakened viruses as vaccines but we did it with smallpox and it seems that this virus is going infect a sizable amount of the population no matter what.

It might make more sense to inject a live weakened virus (like we did with smallpox and measles) in healthy people

Smallpox variolation killed between 1% and 10% of the recipients it was intended to protect, according to Manchu documentation. They did it anyways, because the Manchu had no immunity to smallpox and the fatality is over 90%. But until medical innovations made it safer, Manchu families just sent off their kids to virolation camps and they don't know if they are going to get a health immune kid back or a jar of ashes. We are not doing that with Covid unless safer alternatives are exhausted.

The shortest very-best-scenario timeframe for developing an attenuated live weakened virus vaccine is 18 months. The average is more like 5 years.

We can, but it doesn't change the testing phase. It takes the same amount of time to develop, produce, and test. We aren't ruling out types of vaccines, but we are testing them all the same way. That takes time.

Well I guess that makes sense. I was thinking old school medicine. Take a live culture, heat up weaken the culture, inject it. I understand that a modern day type of vaccine with low amount of risk would be preferable, but it just seems by the time we get an actual vaccine most of the people would have had it by then. A live attenuated vaccine has low risk of long term side effects(the same risk as if you had a mild case) unlike other types of vaccines. It would kill less people then letting the virus run through the population it would save lives.

If it takes as long as to develop live cell cultures then that changes the story.

What are the economic detriments of waiting until the virus stops at the current rate to reopen businesses, versus if everyone were to stay in place (effectively closing some businesses down that are currently open), and the virus were to go away faster, and then we reopen businesses ?

To the best of my knowledge, most economists agree that a harsher but briefer lockdown would be better for the economy than a more lenient one that drags on and on. https://www.ft.com/content/e593e7d4-b82a-4bf9-8497-426eee43bcbc

Question:

I am separated from the mother of my two yr old daughter, I have access every Wednesday and Saturday where I must take her off and bring her back. My ex (daughters mother) emailed my late Friday night to say that my daughter had a high temp and a cough and that I shouldn‚Äôt take her Saturday but maybe come have her Wednesday. Based on the Health guidelines here in Ireland and taking into account that she displayed two of the main symptoms - I said I would refrain from access for 14 days in case it was indeed COVID and I didn‚Äôt want to risk it as I live with my girlfriend who has a 12 yr old and I also have a 14 yr old daughter. My ex needless to say has hit the roof . And demanded that I take the child as normal per the court order - as she needs the break.

Am I in the wrong here?

Hello everyone! Does anyone have any experience making a longer-distanced journey during COVID? I am a university student that was supposed to graduate this semester in Louisiana but am originally from New York. I am planning on driving home because my family is uncomfortable with me going through an airport and the drive is 24 hours (we are potentially having 3 people on this journey). While I do not mind driving long-distance, what I am worried about is the potential lack of public restrooms or places to get food/rest on such a large journey (we are planning on trying to take as few stops as possible). Has anyone had to make a similar road trip during this pandemic and has any advice? Otherwise should I just pack toilet paper to go in fields and woods and try to pack food that will not go bad without refrigeration? Thanks so much y'all! TLDR: Driving 24 hours from Louisiana to NY and need advice on bathrooms, food, and rest stops during COVID

I have never done a road trip during a pandemic, but I have done quite a few 18+ hour road trips. My first suggestion for you is switch drivers every time you fill up (~2 hours). Second, avoid rest stops as they tend to be disgusting and lack major cleaning. Third, gas stations also tend to be dirty so use hand sanitizer as much as possible (don‚Äôt forget to do this when filling up). I suggest wearing a mask when you go inside gas stations. For food your only option should be drive-thru so that should be okay. Remember to use hand sanitizer right before you eat so your hands are clean from touching all the packaging (Straw wrapper, bag, sandwich container, etc.) If you could pack all your food that would be best, but you definitely need a cooler as the last thing you want is food poisoning on a road trip. I hope you all have fun and stay safe!

Thank you so much! I completely forgot about drive-through! Perhaps I will pack for the first half of the journey and then resort to drive-through on the latter half when most perishable things shouldn't be eaten. Thank you for the advice!

there will be less people than normal, so you could easily pee in the woods. bring wipes for your gas pumps and sanitizer.

also, you can go a day without eating, so just pack whatever you want and eat it whenever you want...or at worst, pack two coolers, one with frozen and fridge stuff and one with just fridge stuff. eat the second cooler first and by the end of your journey you can eat the first cooler

Italy Daily Active Case Change_April 12, 2020

It is not graph of total numbers, but a graph of CHANGE (Active Cases for day n, MINUS Active Cases for day n-1). You can see that the growth of ACTIVE cases is slowing down. Once the curve is below zero, it would mean that total number of Active Cases is finally decreasing. It can be due to changes in New Cases, Recoveries and Deaths. Graph also has 7 day Moving Average from the start of the graph and Linear Trendline from the Peak Date of March 21. Active cases data was taken from Worldometers.

Italy was one of the earliest countries with severe outbreak and they implemented measures earlier than many other countries. By tracking their success in fighting COVID19 we can predict when similar improvements may start happening in other countries where similar measures were taken later than in Italy.

It's pretty clear from the graph that actual numbers don't decrease at quite the predicted optimal rate. We also see a pretty regular 7-day phase in under-reporting then catching up.

If you apply that to projections, it's pretty clear Italy won't hit 0 by the 22nd, but it's also clear their measures are working and we're possibly looking at a positive outlook by early May.

Just a speculation... most people I know strongly believe that the government is essentially "controlling" us. When I talk to others about Covid19 they believe the virus is not real, or is being overstated at the least, but are petrified of public embarrassment (or worse) to speak it openly.

I mean it's extremely embarrassing to admit how under-educated one might be. It's a lot easier to double down or get defensive.

Approaching them in a more understanding and empathetic way is able to work wonders, but it takes a lot of effort over a period of time. It's a lot easier to throw stuff at them or get aggressive back at their resistance. Not saying you're necessarily handling it that way, I've just seen this approach used by most people that "want to help".

5G (FIFTH GENERATION) uses radio frequency waves just at difference frequencies and wavelengths than 4G (FOURTH GENERATION) technology, just like 4G has different frequenes than 3G (THIRD GENERATION) and so on.

A virus is a virus, genetic code enveloped by a lipid (fat) wall mounted with proteins that are meant to invade other cells and overtake them.

Radio frequency waves at a different frequency don't magically create virus particles. That's like magic or something.

This is basic science. You probably have the evidence laying around in your 4th grade science textbook.

Ask your Dad to give you peer reviewed scientific evidence that that's the case. When he tells you that the media, and doctors and scientists are in on this, and suppressing the information, which he will, you'll have to accept that your Dad was never going to change his mind, because he's the type of person who believes what he wants to, not fact and truth.

5g operates on non ionizing radiation. The waves are similar in comparison to UHF radios, radar, and ECM. In theory this coronavirus thing would be spreading for years throughout the military if that was the case. Those jets and airplanes have a high enough nose cone power to burn you pretty bad if you stand directly in front of it. Regular lower powered systems if you are up close will give you a ‚Äúsunburn‚Äù.

Like the others said, contact your doctor. If you're like so many without insurance (myself included), contact an urgent care facility and they can give you better advice. Or your city/town's 311/non emergency system. If you have difficulty breathing, call 911 immediately.

I‚Äôm rural person as well with my county having none and the next county over having several. Honestly I don‚Äôt think it makes a difference as people have the same questions as yours. I have seen quite a few of other county license plates at our local grocery stores.

I would just stay away from the store on the weekends, and pay days. Early mornings works in my area there are usually no people around.

Has anyone seen some statistical #s on odds of a individual catching Covid following all safety guidelines? SD, mask, etc. And that's at current levels here in the US.

We don't have nearly enough data to come up with any kind of a meaningful range. We do have some glimmers into your chances of acquiring it from a single exposure event in a confined space with zero preventive measures.

We can also surmise that your chances of becoming infected are an absolute round zero only if you're in an airtight bunker, every item in it has been stored since before November 2019, and you discard and go through multiple airlocks and disinfection stations before donning your pre-sanitized vault suit.

Staying at home, sanitizing surfaces, your chances are low. Someone walks by your window and coughs, chance ticks up a bit. You go to a grocery store, chance increases. Best guess is, if you follow all the guidelines, minimize exposure to others, and take all the precautions with everything you bring in from outside, all of that decreases your chances more than enough to make those precautions worth it.

Any suggestions on how/where to bring plastic bottles to recycle? Already had a bag or 2 filled before restrictions were put in. Now my usual locations, Target and Stop&Shop, aren‚Äôt allowing my recycling indefinitely. Is there anywhere safe to do so individually?

I can assure you not anytime soon. They keep extending instead of giving a long date (or not an specific date) to avoid riot and chaos basically.

Can someone explain why there are so few recorded recoveries in the UK? Most countries that I look at have a 90% recovery, yet in the UK with 10k deaths there are only 300 recoveries?

The UK recovery number has not changed for a week now, I think they just give up on tracking or reporting it.

I've started getting shitty headaches and I'm not sure if it's allergies or the corona. I'm allergic to basically everything and it's spring. Plus the symptoms are similar so I really don't know... i also have allergic asthma so my breathing problem can just be due to allergies. I don't even know TBH.

I read that there will likely be more lockdowns in the future to prevent secondary waves of infections. Have researchers said anything about how long these will be happening? Like should I expect periodic lockdowns for the next couple years? Until a vaccine is approved? Is it expected that more pandemics are going to happen now that we‚Äôve had this one?

I‚Äôm just wondering if I should try moving out of my current city once this initial lockdown lifts, to live somewhere less densely populated if this is what the next 5 years will look like.

I‚Äôve heard to expect a second wave in 6 months. Wether that leads to a lockdown depends a lot on how good we get at testing and tracking. If new cases are detected quickly than it can be contained.

Would that second wave depend on when we come out of this first lockdown?

For context, I‚Äôm in Canada. So our lockdown started at the end of March. I don‚Äôt think any end date has been given but I‚Äôve been assuming it will be at least until June if not September.

Do you think coffee filters for DIY masks are safe?

I just saw a video of a DIY mask made of surgical maks plus a coffee filter between it and nose/mouth.

I'm concerned about inhaling cellulose fibers and nanocrystals from the coffe filters. Am I over concerned?

Thank you all

Got tested at a drive thru today! They called out of the blue on Friday and apologized it took so long (I called the hotline sometime on March 18th). Not even sure the test will be valid because I no longer have symptoms. But we'll see. Also can't wait for the antibody test to know definitely if what I was sick with for 2.5 weeks was indeed COVID-19.

Question regarding hardwood flooring. I‚Äôve been using a Swiffer with multipurpose solution that‚Äôs safe on hardwood and was wondering how efficient of a cleaner it is.

As an alternative to be on the safer side, I‚Äôve been filling up a squirt bottle with hot water and dawn dish soap to spray on the floor before every cleaning. In terms of disinfecting I don‚Äôt really know what to do there.

Living with my dad I instituted an outside shoe by the door policy, whereabouts otherwise we just walk in the house with slippers that never go outside, but obviously I want to be on the safe side since we have a cat that loves to jump on furniture and our beds.

To check if the muscles are tight you can try this: sit up straight, stick your arms straight out in front of you with one hand on top of the other. Roll your shoulders forward like you're trying to get them to touch in front of you. Then slowly lower your head forward and feel for a stretch in your upper back behind your shoulder blades. If they're tight you can try holding the stretch for a few seconds to help loosen the muscles.

We don‚Äôt really know about Africa though. Its hard to get a test here in the US so I‚Äôm pretty sure its next to impossible in countries like Somalia, DRC, Sudan etc... there have been posts and comments here from people that have said people are just dying there and not getting counted. The virus is thriving in some hot climates in South American countries like Brazil, Ecuador, Columbia and Peru but they also are not testing adequately. For example Brazil with a population of 209 million people have only tested 60,000 people. Also Dr. Fauci said he doesn‚Äôt think it will disappear with warmer weather.

Better training, PPE and pay for the staff, spacing out the dining pattern so people can get a little distance when they need to be in the same room. The amount of PPE allocated to senior residences is shamefully low and make hopsitals look like paradise in comparison.

Can insanity result from coronavirus? I have had a fever for about 4 or 5 days straight now and I'm pretty sure it's corona. Never felt anything like this before, my only symptoms were very infrequent diarrhea and extreme fatigue everyday but now today I feel like I am legit going insane. Like I am extremely irritable and want to punch a hole in my wall and can hardly sit still.

I have been unable to do my schoolwork for days because of the extreme fatigue. I am on the verge of tears I am losing it.

I have to wear a mask for work now, all I can get ahold of is a cloth mask, better than nothing I suppose. I will be getting another to alternate when I can, funds are making that hard. I'm trying to figure out how to clean it. I work 10hr shifts, so it will be on my face around 12. I do not own a microwave as I've seen zapping it for a little killed viruses, I do not have the ability to use the washer and dryer every night (live in an apt, have to pay), have been unable to get disinfectant spray. I do have lysol multi surface cleaner, but I dont know if that would be helpful, or make me ill from fumes in my face. Any idea what I can do to at least somewhat clean it every night? Thanks for any ideas guys.

Do you have any chlorine bleach? Can you get another cloth mask? You can hand wash the mask with a little detergent and bleach every night then hang to dry. alternate with a second mask so one has time to thoroughly dry.

Is there any way to test if you‚Äôve already had coronavirus? I developed a soar throat around March 15th and then got more symptoms like coughing, a slight fever for 2 days, severe congestion which caused mild headaches, tired but nowhere near the point where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, and no body aches. I caught the cold from my dad and grandmother who had most likely caught it when my dad had to take my grandmother to the hospital a few days before for a slow heart rate. It‚Äôs took all of us about 3-4 weeks to kick the cold. My grandmother(79F) felt pretty terrible, my dad (50M) slightly better, and I (24F) handled it the best. My grandmother lost her sense of taste and hasn‚Äôt gotten it back yet. My dad lost his sense of smell but has already gotten it mostly back. I was not affected with either of those. This is in Ft. Lauderdale Florida.

Legally, you're ALLOWED to work as an essential worker. The one requiring you to work is your employer under penalty of being fired. Of course, society as a whole needs people to do the essential jobs so we can eat and keep hospitals working and have electricity, water, garbage pickup, etc etc etc.

Read up on the Federal CARES ACT that was just enacted. It has some stuff in there if you are the caregiver or need to look after your grandparents and getting 2 extra weeks off paid. Not sure if it applies to you but it might if ....it does apply to you? You know? There's also extended leave so they cannot fire you. But read up on it and see if you can work it out with your HR.

Take a look at https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g04dco/the_covid19_vaccine_development_landscape/ Some vaccines are already in Phase One clinical trials, which is way earlier than the normal development process. There is definitely a lot of red tape being cut to accelerate the vaccine development efforts.

I really don't know where to post this question, but I was wondering if anyone could help me in regards to unemployment benefits due to coronavirus. My dad is a self-employed, small business owner. He is a dry cleaning mechanic (repairs, installs, and occasionally sells dry cleaning equipment and machinery).

I understand that unemployment benefits are meant for those who are an employEE, not self-employed individuals. But, my father heard that his friends have claimed unemployment insurance benefits. Am I missing something here? I live in NJ. Thanks in advance.

Check the NJ website for unemployment. Basically to get unemployment money even as self employed it has to go through the state unemployment.

Certain states are setting up their own things. A state may reject state unemployment money but give the $600 from the federal unemployment money. Other states may also be allowing their own unemployment benefits on top of the $600. NY has a system where you have to apply, get rejected through the normal system and then you can collect the self employed unemployment money.

Edit: Found this question on NJ site that says what to do.

As long as you can keep proper distancing from other people and it is permitted in your area, going out for walks is more beneficial than risky. Still be mindful of what you touch while outside. Take care

Escapism is the go to drug in times like these, the news are too sobering. We need to be our own psychologist, and use the internet to find communication with others. There has never been a time where so many people were stuck in the same boat, but felt so secluded individually. Use the internet to discover that you're not alone. Feeling alone is a state of mind, not a reality.

There are also plenty of free services where you can talk to a licensed therapist. Granted not every therapist will work for you, but it's 1000% worth the effort to find the right one.

I do agree that we need to stay social and reach out to each other more now than ever.

Is migraine a symptom? I developed a mild migraine which keeps coming and going away for the past 24 hours. It was focused around my left eye few hours ago and now it's gone again but I feel it's just somewhere there.

Also, I've had sinus issues for a long time(several years). Would that be an underlying condition that makes me more susceptible to the virus or does it affect my mortality in case I contact it?

Look up the CDC or WHO list of symptoms, if I remember correctly migraine is not on it. "Sinus issues" is really too vague. Most respiratory issues focus on lungs in the case of covid-19.

I'm just at a lost, last year my tax return was too small to be direct deposited, I entered my direct deposit info but they said it would be mailed because it has to be a certain amount to be direct deposited, I was out of work for a really long time due to some life threatening medical issues that I just recovered from this year. Would they send my stimulus check in the mail or direct deposit? I cant find any info anywhere about it...

This Friday the IRS will have a web portal up for people who weren't able to provide their direct deposit info when they filed their taxes this year. Otherwise the checks will be mailed beginning of May.

Edit: here's the direct link of where to find it when it goes live - https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments

Filers: Get Your Payment

Use the "Get My Payment" application (coming mid-April) to:

Check your payment status

Confirm your payment type: direct deposit or check

Enter your bank account information for direct deposit if we don't have  your direct deposit information and we haven't sent your payment yet

Get My Payment (coming mid-April)

How long does the coronavirus live on outdoor surfaces like door knobs and gates?

Does exposure to the elements (sun, wind, temperature variations etc) help degrade the virus faster than if it were indoors?

For example, there is an outdoor gate with a door knob to access my condo complex, all residents have to touch this door knob on the gate to get in and out. How long does coronavirus live on it and what's the best way to protect myself (only open the gate wearing gloves, try to lysol it before touching with bare hands, etc)?

Just don't touch your face until you wash your hands, it really is that simple. The virus can't magically get into your body through your skin, or crawl along your skin to your mouth or whatever.

You get infected by breathing it in if someone has just coughed/sneezed/breathed really close to you or if you touch something and then touch your face.

So if you just don't touch your face, nose, ears, mouth until you wash your hands, you are good.

Google for the exact durations. I guess you could say those are lab conditions. So in real world outside considerably less. To protect yourself is easy. Wash hands often. Especially when you go back inside your home. Don't touch your face. To carry Lysol wipes everywhere is hyper vigilant, maybe a bit overkill.

I have, but I've only found those lab studies re various surfaces, and general stuff about UV, but nothing specific about surfaces outdoors or exposed to the elements. As you said, I would expect the virus to not survive as long, but can't find any info on it. Maybe it hasn't been studied yet.

Without knowing for sure, the best advice would be to proceed as if the virus is on those surfaces and respond accordingly. Don‚Äôt touch your face and wash your hands as soon as you can after going outside.

Don't focus on that duration... Wash your hands and it is gone. Simple. It's not catchable through skin contact. Only if you touch your lips or nose, "moist" areas. So wash your hands and don't touch your face is the solution.

Research is saying about 7 days for metal, I would use that for doorknob. There is not enough UV in sunlight to dramatically degrade the virus but wind seems to help speed it up. I would say the best option is to carry a small bottle of 60-70% alcohol, touch the gate normally, and clean your hands immediately afterwards.

If you want a serious answer, I would tell you to focus on keeping a routine. Work. Exercise. Don‚Äôt get lazy. Learn new things. Make your time count.

If you want a not so serious answer, I would tell you to drink some bourbon, smoke some weed, watch some tv, play video games and get as much sleep as possible.

A reasonable answer? A little of both.

Not everyone lives near a family member, so rather not make a claim or trip.

Claiming means you are responsible for the body, and the costs that go along with it.

Not everyone has a family. Not everyone has kids.

Lots of old folks got abandoned when they passed away pre covid19, esp those in nursing homes. Some never even had children. It's pretty sad. Now, because of the virus it feels like a lot more than usual, but it's not.

I find it ironic that the former CDC director Frieden is all over the news offering advice.

His NYT opinion piece proclaims that if only he were in charge things would be better.  Aside from the lack of humility and charity toward CDC, let's look at his record. Frieden‚Äôs leadership while CDC director contributed to at least some of the lack of preparation and failings we see today. 

Frieden's CDC's Ebola response was shambolic and narrowly avoided a major catastrophe.  His response included letting individual hospitals manage on their own, a West African Ebola patient who wandered out of a Texas ER, a mayor-led outbreak investigation, infected nurses, the hundreds of exposed people on planes and cruise ships, inadequate CDC infection control recommendations, multiple imported Ebola patients to the US, and feeble airport screening.  Calls for Frieden's resignation culminated in his replacement by Fauci as Obama's spokesperson. His CDC leadership on HIV is no less troubling.  The latest available CDC data (2016) on treatment with viral suppression is only 53% and ~40,000 new infections a year-- lower than at least 20 countries in Europe and Africa. 

The failings of CDC and the current administration is a bipartisan problem that results from the multiple administrations' inadequate preparation for the pandemic. While the current mismanagement of COVID-19 is glaring, our lack of leadership and equitable investment in improving the health of our citizens is a chronic disease.

I see now that a growing number of scientists in my own country (Norway) is starting to advocate for taking a swedish approach to the situation. It's hard to know what the majority thinks of course, and I still see quite a lot of doctors advocating for a lockdown type of approach, but it seems like FHI (people healths insitute) are gradually adopoting this approach. Not sure what to think about it to be honest!

A sensational acceleration on the coronavirus vaccine : already at the end of April the first human tests, on 550 healthy volunteers . The drug that will be tested is the vaccine developed by the Advent-Irbm company of Pomezia together with the Jenner Institute of Oxford University. This was announced by the CEO of Irbm, Piero Di Lorenzo . It is expected, he says, "to make the vaccine usable as early as September to vaccinate healthcare professionals and law enforcement in compassionate use."

That'd be kind of cool, way better than 1 1/2 years. I wonder how promising it really is?

I have a question on regard of the coming vaccines.

Let's suppose they have a vaccination site in some months and people must go take the vaccines.

If there is a line of people to get a vaccine and one of them is infected with the virus, if someone not infected in the line gets infected by that person and then takes the vaccine, what would happen? Will the vaccine work faster or does it take too long to adapt and would be useless?

Can someone ELI5 the argument that we need to be quarantining until there‚Äôs a vaccine on the market? I GET ITS NOT THE FLU, but people still get the flu after getting the flu vaccine (from what I understand they pick what they think is gonna be the most popular type of flu and vaccinate you against that). It‚Äôs not realistic to think we‚Äôre gonna be in like this for another year

the idea is be quite for a while, until we could handle the situation and not overwhelm the health system even more. Then keep taking precautions to don¬¥t have more waves, meaning testing a lot, isolate positives asap and don¬¥t let this spread again like fire. That¬¥s the idea, the vaccine is a long term goal.

The argument is that we don‚Äôt have a treatment for this one. We think it‚Äôs mutating slowly, and I think there are only two strains. I don‚Äôt know all the ins and outs of the flu vaccine, but I guarantee the vaccine for this will be a broad as possible. Unlimited federal R&D money ensures that.

I don‚Äôt think there is any chance we stay quarantined for another year. And I don‚Äôt know how we stop this thing in any less than a year. So, I guess I don‚Äôt have a solution.

This may already be answered and I‚Äôm very sorry if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve obviously missed. My wife just had a terrible experience in the E.R., she was stripped of her dignity, treated like someone coming down from drugs, they allowed her to walk through the hall with a boob hanging out because she was literally so cold from not being allowed a blanket that she couldn‚Äôt tell it was out. When she got back to her room and noticed it, she realized that must have been what the old man was smiling/laughing about.

Anyway, the really concerning thing (as if the way she was treated isn‚Äôt concerning). Is how her COVID test was performed and I‚Äôm curious if this is normal; the nurse performing the test brought out a q tip about 6 inches long, restrained my wife by pushing hear head down, and crammed the qtip so far up her nasal passage that she screamed in pain. This was all on Saturday, I have so much more horror to express but ultimately my wife refused further treatment and left. What in the actual f***? She‚Äôs been blowing blood out of her nose ever since, says she feels like something is dislodged in her nasal passage up by her eyeball. They took 2 large bottles of blood, about 3-5 small ones, from a woman that weighs about 110 pounds. They refused to even give her water afterwards unless she gave them a urine sample ‚Äî people that donate that much blood are instantly given a soda and snack cake, she was given a shitty glass of water after presumably turning in her urine for a drug test.

They refused to help her dress (she recently pulled a muscle in her shoulder and was shivering uncontrollably, had fallen down, couldn‚Äôt walk straight). She tried to purchase a soda and wasn‚Äôt even allowed that. When she told me this via text I tried to enter the hospital to help ‚Äî the lady at the desk said she was going to make sure my wife was ok with me coming in first, she came back and said I wasn‚Äôt allowed in... my wife definitely didn‚Äôt say that, the abusive nurse did. She said ‚Äúyour husband can‚Äôt come in but I‚Äôll help you dress if you finish your IV and take this shot‚Äù (a steroid). The nurse at one point said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre so mad at me, I was the one out in the hallway trying to get the doctor to let me put Xanax or something in your IV‚Äù.

The nasal test caused her to vomit, they wouldn‚Äôt help her clean it, and nurse wouldn‚Äôt give her anything to clean it with ‚Äúuntil she got back‚Äù. I have no idea what to do. We work hard, we pay for our insurance, we aren‚Äôt druggies, and I can‚Äôt believe she was treated like such shit. I don‚Äôt know what to do here; I wouldn‚Äôt pay someone to treat my worst enemy like that, how will I bring myself to write a check to these people that treated the love of my life like that?

Well, that‚Äôs some shit. It‚Äôs probably best to write an op ed to your local newspaper. My hospital has an ombudsman, I know for a fact she investigates every error or mistreatment of a patient. Not every hospital has that.

That‚Äôs a good idea. I called this morning for them to prepare her medical records for me to pick up later and I planned to begin with the Illinois patient grievances, wait a few days and then contact the hospitals patient grievances line. But I wanted to make sure the state got the report and a little time to crawl up their ass before I gave them any heads up that an ass crawling is imminent.

This is probably going to be very controversial but IMO this pandemic has exposed the density of cities like NYC as an objectively bad quality that people should be wary of if they‚Äôre considering moving to that metro.

I think people need to consider how the city they‚Äôre moving to will be affected in a time of crisis when deciding where to move.

Cities are dramatically better for the climate than small towns, so outside of a literal pandemic they are actually very beneficial. Also, deaths per capita are very similar in New Orleans and NYC. Finally, the parts of New York that have a high density of cases are Queens and Brooklyn, which are similarly dense to many smaller cities.

Also people from Queens and Brooklyn have access to Manhattan (and vise versa) so the density of residential homes in those boroughs is kind of irrelevant. In order for a city to be less susceptible to this pandemic, it can‚Äôt have any super dense areas (meaning cities like San Francisco or Chicago probably aren‚Äôt good places to be right now either)

Not true for all boroughs, if you want something that feels like parts of Brooklyn or Staten Island, etc. you‚Äôve got tons of cities that feel similar, not identical but enough to give you most of the things you‚Äôre looking for.

I think that migration is inevitable as costs in huge cities rise and people realize that maybe they should give a smaller city with a good reputation and a lower cost of living like Des Moines a chance. COVID might accelerate that process but it‚Äôs going to happen anyway.

From what I understand a lot of property values is based on some sort of feedback loop, which is why cities in the south and parts of the Midwest are cheap despite transplants flocking there (the feedback loop hasn‚Äôt become a thing in those places). So no

Explain every other country on the planet that's experiencing outbreaks as a result of having done nothing, and only now showing improved numbers as a result of lockdowns.

You never bothered to reply to me earlier, but I asked you the same question. Do you actually think that if we all just go back to work, open up bars and restaurants, etc, that things won't get worse again?

They said something vague like the real death toll is higher than the official numbers. By how much? A factor of two? Ten fold? Not very useful.

If you lift the lockdowns, you need to be able to do 3 things to keep a second wave of cases low:

point of origin diagnostic testing. This means, local doctors able to test a patient for covid-19 and get results back quickly.

Quick and efficient serological testing. This means, the ability to see if someone has already had the disease and has antibodies for it. This helps prevent health care workers from being quarantined for no reason.

Efficient contact tracing of patients who test positive for covid-19. This way you can have people who have had contact with an infected person self-quarantine until they have been tested for the virus.

Question: my wife and I have flexible jobs so we‚Äôve been working half days and splitting child care. This is not sustainable long-term for our work.

From a public health perspective, which is more advisable: 1) flying in a young relative who can live in our home and babysit? or 2) paying for a part-time babysitter? 1 involves exposure due to air travel, but 2 involves someone who will regularly see other people locally.

How about a neighbor or friend who is looking for extra cash amidst temporary job loss? Someone who is quarantining, and is healthy enough that should your jobs expose the child and them to the virus, it should be survivable.

That is basically option 2, the part-time babysitter. She‚Äôs a young woman in good health and otherwise quarantining. But since she has her own household and family, I worry that she‚Äôll be a worse exposure risk than the one-time flight.

Well, by quarantined, I mean with people who are actually quarantining. You all are not quarantined right now, as you are working. If she is the only one in the household not quarantined (working outside the home like you), and she's willing to risk her health and the health of her family, ok. You are just, essentially, expanding your household members by one household if you're only exposing each other. HOWEVER... if she has a husband who is working outside of the home, and a 20 year old daughter who is still going to stay with her boyfriend 3 times a week. And the boyfriend lives with roommates and 2 of them have jobs and 1 is just inviting people over left and right... then basically everyone is at risk. At that point you might as well all expose yourselves and get it over with. Then it doesn't matter who watches your child after you are all recovered... assuming you all recover.

Yes, but there's nothing really relevant or significant about much of the discussion I'm seeing. Here's an oldie that shows more of what I'm talking about:

Lytle, C. D., & Sagripanti, J. L. (2005). Predicted inactivation of viruses of relevance to biodefense by solar radiation. Journal of virology, 79(22), 14244‚Äì14252. https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.22.14244-14252.2005

Leaving items out in the sun would work, but the bigger, more significant picture is that the sun will be the only thing that will solve this "COVID-19 problem" gridlocking our world today. More emphasis needs to be placed on the seasonal change from solstice to equinox, especially by big media. This will allow people to be more rational and less fearful of what is to come of this.

If you have good handwashing habits, maybe check for volunteer grocery delivery and other programs in your area? Facebook also have a cool function where you can ask or offer help to those around you, in my area its mostly picking up drugs for pharmacies for those who are too high risk to leave their homes.

Not seen a single study or article linking the disproportionate amount of African-Americans dying from Covid-19 to the well documented and studied fact that forms of Anaemia and Sickle cell trait are 3 times more common in black Americans than white Americans. This would confirm all the new information showing that the virus attacks hemoglobin preventing oxygen from being absorbed by red blood cells. This is a blood disease that attack the lungs not a lung disease that attacks the blood. Surely people being treated for pneumonia are being treated for the wrong disease?

Saw this on Facebook. How dumb is it?

Do any of you think that China has to offer other countries financial aid or at the very least admit that it's their fault in the first place?

No, if the next deadly virus comes from a pig farm in Arkansas I won't expect my government to compensate other nations. These things can come from anywhere the right conditions exist.

I understand the need to appear non-partisan but we‚Äôre Beyond that point when one party actively is trying to mitigate this disaster and their legislation is not enough to help with it. I am asking in the general thread just to reconsider.

A friend of mine just shared this article. I know that we need lockdowns. I feel like I‚Äôve seen so many articles showing how they help. But I can‚Äôt find a good article to respond with or think of how to show why this is wrong. Does anyone have a useful response?

I can't comment whether that would work or not, but the reason we are under lockdown isn't because we're trying to stop the virus dead in it's tracks, it's giving our health and emergency services the time they need to cope. Prolonging the virus is exactly what we need to do; even if in the long run more people are infected it will have been spread over a longer period of time, meaning that hospitals and ambulances can handle the influx of patients. If you just lifted the restrictions, then yes, over 80% of national populations will most likely be infected and herd immunity will take place, but in the meantime thousands upon thousands of people (even if they're low risk!) will be left without access to a respirator.

This sounds very much like what Sweden is trying to do. Pay attention to Sweden to see if this is a viable strategy for a nation of 10 million. Note that US is a nation of 330 million, so if we convert Sweden's total deaths to per million and multiply we get:

899 x 33 = 29667 equivalent deaths for the US.

in terms of cases, 10,483 x 33 = 345,939 equivalent cases. So right now, it looks like Sweden is killing more per capita with its strategy, but keeping overall cases down.

it would be worthwhile to do the same math on testing, they are testing roughly 60% as many as the US (which already sucks) so likely they are missing lots of positives

So 5400 per million. Way less than countries or states with low growth rates and a better grasp of total infected. Even my state of Alaska is over 10,000 per million.

I just went to the Public Health agency for Sweden. They changed their testing strategy on March 13th. So they have a lot more positives than is being reported.

The healthcare services in Sweden prioritise the following groups:

Hospitalised patients

People that work in healthcare or elderly care, with suspected COVID-19.
The aim with this priority is to protect those that are most vulnerable and most exposed for the virus.

Anyone who is ill with symptoms of cold or flu should stay at home in order to minimize the risk of passing the illness on to others. This group will not be prioritised for testing.

that's similar to the US plan right now. basically anywhere that has over 5% positive rate is not testing enough to catch the mild cases

When politics is mentioned it devolves into circlejerks for and against the candidate. It turns the discussion from "This administration should have done x y or z" to "Well, you know ALL (people of this ideology think like this)" and it's either massive downvote brigades or upvote brigades for all.

It causes the "high quality" discussion that this sub is supposed to be geared towards to degenerate into political shitflinging fests. If you want to talk about politics with people you agree with, you can just post all your Coronavirus articles on rpolitics or rworldnews

People of the USA ..... Is it legal for your company to make you work without providing proper supplies to combat the virus Ie gloves masks sanitizer etc? Mind you we are a security company and can not maintain a 6 foot distance from other people since we have to take their licenses.

Your options are quit or stay employed. If there aren‚Äôt enough supplies for hospitals then I don‚Äôt see how security companies are going to be able to supply proper PPE. It sucks, but one of the things about the erosion of worker‚Äôs rights in the US is that workers have very little legal recourse, especially under this administration. OSHA is a joke. I‚Äôm very sorry you‚Äôre dealing with such a bad situation.

I think the latest news on the case fatality rate and our ability to flatten the curve has been pretty positive over the last 4-5 days. Of all the outcomes we thought were possible a couple weeks ago, it seems we're on a pretty favorable trajectory.

Basically no hospitals in the US are currently overrun and out of ventilators, which was the fear.

It's bad, but it's looking like it could have been much worse. So, I'd say it's getting better.

Hey bud alcohol actually increases anxiety overall. Weed too, anything that ‚Äúmakes it go away‚Äù temporarily will cause it to spike later, an affect that you don‚Äôt get if you abstain. Not that you can‚Äôt drink or smoke, but just consider that overall you‚Äôre increasing your anxiety if that‚Äôs your reason for doing it

Coronavirus seems to be precipitating anxiety and substance abuse issues people already had before the pandemic. Talking out your anxiety and worries with a trusted person, or a therapist works infinitely better than heavy drinking. There are a multitude of teletherapy apps with licensed therapists, and some states are offering this for free if you can't afford it. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health, and heavy drinking takes a heavy toll on both.

With all that said, I know exactly where you're coming from. I've broken out of it and got the help I needed, I believe anyone can too, including you.

My suggestion would be to aim for at least 5 or 6 days a week booze free. Obviously not drinking at all will be the best but having some here and there to stay sane is not the end of the world. When you start going multiple days in a row it can spiral out of control pretty quick.

Getting extra stuff without going crazy seemed to be the best policy a month or so ago. I got lots of rice and beans and other things. But I also got 2 ounces of legal bud. It is sweet medicine for me.

I also got 60 bottles of red wine at a place that uses wine kits. This is also medicine for me.

I live alone, so I need some pleasure during covid-19.

Not a full quarantine. But unless they change the approach, it's unlikely that sports, concerts, and leisurely travel will come back until there's a vaccine.

3 hours on printing paper, 1 day on cardboard paper, receipts are probably closer to 1 day - in general the virus seem to last better on shiny, glossy surfaces and die quicker on soft porous surfaces. https://covidpapers.github.io/posts/stability-of-sars-cov-2-in-different-environmental-conditions/#.XooRVhkGU04.reddit

Yes but it's important to note that this is under lab conditions.

The virus sitting on a cardboard box that gets picked up, jostled around, thrown into the back of a very hot delivery truck, and left on a porch in which the sun is shining on the virus will likely not remain viable for nearly as long as a virus sitting on a cardboard box in the corner of a sterile lab.

I mean it could I suppose, but not likely.

For sure, the research only offers a safe upper bound. They also use a log scale, so we know the virus deteriorate rapidly over time. Also, "detectable" does not necessarily mean "viable". Right now we don't know what amount of virus is required to cause an infection, but I'll be surprised if any surface can still be infectious after a couple of days or so.

Excuse my ignorance but I‚Äôm not understanding, since this virus theoretically started with one person, would it not be possible for just one single infected person to cause another outbreak?

In Korea, one single "super-spreader" is believe to be responsible for thousands of cases. It does sound like this person coughed all over the place without covering mouth and went to multiple huge gatherings, so in the post lockdown world the new outbreaks ought be smaller with distancing and masking, but you never know.

You are right and it's not possible to prevent further outbreaks.

All measures taken against the virus aim to slow down the spread and control it to a point, where hospitals can handle the epidemic. Once that's done, we can take stock and see how to handle the pandemic going forward.

We will most likely live with restrictions of some kind until a vaccine is thoroughly tested and produced in quantity, which, by most estimates, will still take about a year. Until then we have to figure out how to best handle the situation. We can't just lock down entire countries indefinitely, nor can we just let the virus run rampant.

e.g. in the EU they are working on a mobile app that uses bluetooth to log anyone you've had contact with the last 14 days and messages you when anyone of them gets tested positive and gives you guidance, whether to get tested/self isolate etc.. The aim of the app is to be able to faster and more accurately locate outbreaks and minimize there impact. In turn they might be able to ease restrictions. Some Asian countries are using similar methods to track their people.

Yes, it's a terrifying situation. All those owners of small shops will probably be done already in a month or two, and not to speak of those who work every month for low wages to pay food and rent.

Governments can help, but for how long until it's over? When people get desperate, it gets really dangerous. I hope it won't come to that and those in power have a better plan than nothing this second time.

Hoping for that gives me the most anxiety actually in the entire affair.

Lol. The world knows Covid19 comes from bats in Yunnan. They have been testing those SAME BATS and have found over 300 strains of coronavirus. In 2015 they altered and CREATED a strain that could infect HeLa AKA humans. China denied it came from the lab but then ADMITTED they had been testing these exact same bats for years.

People hate anything that smells like a conspiracy theory which is bad because once in a great while a conspiracy theory turns out to be true. I personally enjoy dispelling conspiracy theories but this one has some real facts to support it. Here's a good youtube video that posts the links to all their sources, most of which are directly from Chinese government websites: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpQFCcSI0pU

And yeah, it's a random person on YouTube talking about a theory, but they do a good job at presenting the current facts that have been discovered. I checked out the links myself (and you can too, I encourage people to always verify sources), everything he said in the video is confirmed by those sources. Granted there isn't enough evidence to say with 100% certainty this is what happened, but it starts the groundwork for something that should be investigated (and is going to be).

On top of all that, this "theory" isn't even really nefarious or sinister (besides the CCP hiding the death/killing of the graduate student). It's mostly about the CCP's arrogance, incompetence, and ignorance. They didn't want to look stupid which resulted in many people dying. Of course they don't want the real truth to get out now, that'll make them look even more stupid. I mean it's the CCP we're talking about, not really shocking if this is all true.

The theory I heard was that scientists were researching the virus in lab that they found in infected nearby villagers. A graduate student was accidentally exposed and became infected, and infected the rest of the lab staff. The Chinese CDC is 300 meters away from the Huanan Seafood Market, so it would be pretty easy to pin that f*** up on a wet market.

We won‚Äôt all die, but if the able bodied unemployment gets into the 15-20 percent range people will be in street, drug addiction rates will sky rocket, DUI deaths, violent crimes, burglaries, neglect of children. All of that stuff will cause deaths. So their is a cost to an extended lockdown.

US has a large population and this is a US dominated website. EU meanwhile usually segregates into their separate country communities and will never have the population to push something to the front.

US is the hot topic right now. Everyone in the US is concerned, and everyone in the EU wants the US to fail badly.

We were supposed to see a surge in California even with social distancing and it's just not coming. This is all starting to seem like nonsense. I'm celebrating Easter with Grandma and Grandpa. We've all been quarantined for 3 weeks and there's no danger in visiting each other.

It‚Äôs tiresome to see the same nonsense about how it‚Äôs all some media hoax being repeated so often. the stay at home orders are doing what they are supposed to in most areas. what a pleasant surprise, but sure as hell if we lift restrictions too soon, those bad projections could become reality, there‚Äôs no winning the argument.

No, if you look at the "Red Dawn" emails you will see the experts there were concerned of the appropriate things at the appropriate times. They were saying the same things people were posting on these forums in Jan/Feb.

They were ignored by the decision makers thought because Reasons.

Anyone else is pessimistic for the next months? It is my understanding that:

-there is more than one strain worldwide, which could mean one vaccine would not benefit all

-as soon as China and moreover Singapore were done the with the first wave, the very moment they reopened for business, the virus flared up and they had no choice but to lockdown again

-there is suspicion of long term sequelae after-effets on the central nervous system

-between the uncertainty, the lockdowns, the economic effects, the deaths, the political consequences, the waves, the lies and false hopes... we're just all going crazy...

If it helps, most vaccine researchers believe that there will be crossover protection between different strains, which we know to be true for flu vaccines. Coronaviruses also historically mutated slower than influenza viruses. Take care and do what you can for your mental health, seek help when you need it.

I just want to remind everybody: Waiting until the situation is as bad as it can get before deciding to end lockdowns is doing the exact same thing as waiting until covid has already started spreading like wildfire to start lockdowns...except that all of the other things are even more important.

Imagine what happens if the medicine supply chain gets disrupted.

Most times, the best response is no response at all. We must continue to be very vigilante and do what ever we feel we have to do in order to protect ourselves even if others feel there is no need for them to do so.

That fatality rate in FL is about 8 days behind the fatality rate of NY which has grown since the outbreak began. Deaths lag infections. I have seen 0 evidence deaths are being covered up and there's so many people involved I think it'd be awfully hard to do.

There are other states who are lagging 8days behind who have way more deaths. They are probably doing what France did early on and not counting nursing home deaths.

I'm comparing them to states that have a similar number of cases.

La. - 20,595 cases 840 deaths

Fla. - 19,347 cases 452 deaths

Ill. - 19,180 cases 677 deaths

It doesn't add up.

It's percentages so there's no need to limit it to states with very similar cases but Pensalyina has 23k, 4th most. Cali also has a death rate that is still below 3% even though it was one of the first effected states. You have 0 evidence and are making huge claims. If that was happening there'd be families coming forward saying their loved one wasnt counted.

How would those families know they weren't counted? And let's not forget that there have been many (anecdotal of course) cases of states not counting deaths already. Even New York hasnt counted them all. The state acknowledged that home deaths have gone up from 25 per day to 200 per day.

Add to that the fact that Desantis is a corrupt piece of shit, he didn't take this seriously and the age of Floridians and this is highly suspect.

Maybe this isn't the smoking gun for you, but I think history will prove me right. But we'll see. Thanks for keeping it civil.

Deaths are being recorded at the county level. Lots of counties have 0 or 1 deaths per day. So it's pretty easy to tell if someone was counted in that case or not.

Japan (127 million people): 6,748 cases; 108 deaths

New York City (8.9 million people): 103,208 cases; 6,898 deaths

U.S. media: OH MY GOD! Japan's death rate is absolutely "skyrocketing" -- 9 new deaths from April 10th to April 11th! Why don't the Japanese care about protecting life?! Severe lockdowns are the only way to control this virus. Nothing else will work. Surgical approaches involving robust primary health care -- to keep people out of hospitals -- and widespread adoption of good hygiene will not help. The only thing that will work is locking people at home for two months. We should never consider whether dysfunctional dirty cities without adequate social welfare policies and without universal health care -- New York, for example -- could be making our population more vulnerable and we should just keep our economy and society "locked down" forever and ever.

US Media follows the hype of could have would have should have and then criticizes other countries not doing what they are doing. Then talk about how much health is the only factor in play. F the economy, while they sit behind their fat paychecks to scare the public.

The U.S. has screwed up. What's happened in New York City is extremely bad, but the point is that they're not properly analyzing why other countries have been more successful. And instead sort of just wishing doom upon them!

It‚Äôs so much more complicated though. Countries having different outcomes, and different strategies. One mitigation technique might work one place and not another. Way over the heads of an opinionated media talking head. It is messed up that they push those motives. They want Sweden and Japan to fail in their strategies it seems.

They still have mitigation plans in effect just very loose. Let the population make their own decisions to stay home. Protecting their elderly and having people phone in to hospitals before they come in are the ones that I know of.

It's brilliant, really! We'll use the virus to shut down the economy, force consumers inside and lose their jobs, destroying the demand for the products that the Chinese manufacturing base was made to cater to, wait...

I don't think it was biowarfare but I wouldn't be surprised if China was studying it and it escaped the lab.

You will get downvoted for even mentioning this.

Google 'Wuhan Institute of Virology' and read about how SARS has already 'escaped' twice.

Then read this article. It's ADMITTED that they have been experimenting on the bats from the Yunnan cave where Covid19 is CONFIRMED to have come from!!

if you're both quarantining alone, why aren't you just going to move all your food into the other house and live there?

Well, you don‚Äôt live alone and neither do they (if they‚Äôre 16), so you‚Äôre exposed to more than just each other...you‚Äôre also exposed to their families, and whoever their families have been exposed to.

Unless both of your entire households have been under perfect quarantine (ie, not even any grocery runs), then this is not advisable.

Easter bump? Covid-19 ready to pounce during Easter dinner. We were doing so good flattening the curve, when people just had to visit ‚Äúbig momma‚Äù, ‚Äúabuelita‚Äù, family and friends for the holiday! Thanks for increasing the infection rate, and possibly extending the quarantine! Remember the words of the bus driver who died four days after a lady cough on his bus, ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt no MFing joke!‚Äù Sorry, not sorry!ü•∫üôÑ

So, I have been following this pandemic since day one (well, day one since Chinese reported it two months later). Well, when this all started in China we looked at the country in fear, then we saw that the death rate wasnt as high as expected (2-2.5%). But I always questioned myself... this is the real info or are we being deceived?

Current day, death rate globally is around 6%, with some countries peaking 10-12%... that means we have been lied. That makes this whole situation a lot more scary. And even worse, most of the positive hopes we had failed so we are stuck with the bad news.

This makes me think that we are for something far more worse than Spanish Flu...

What do you think?

Death rate isn't anywhere close to 6-12%. I'm guessing you didn't account for all the untested cases, which might be at least 10 times as numerous as the confirmed ones due to the slow and insufficient rate of testing.

Just because a country has 100K confirmed cases and 10K deaths doesn't mean the actual death rate is 10% ; it's likely to be much lower because a million or more could have the virus asymptomatically enough and be left out of the equation. Testing currently sucks overall while deaths are far more accurately reported.

Coronavirus, ebola, krakatoa explodes, and apparently there's a bird disease making the rounds. Throw in some good old fires and floods and we got a good case that humanity is nearing the end of their reign on this planet. It's been a good run, boys.

Look at Sweden. They are doing great job by allowing people to get infected and by that they will achieve herd immunity.

Economy will not suffer and everything is opened.

Their mortality rate isn't much worse in comparision with those who have quarantine.

And guess what swedes will give a flying f*** about vaccine. Most of population will achieve immunity from this freakin virus.

Look at Euro Momo statistics...and open your eyes. This year mortality rate across Europe is not worsr than previous year.

But of course people will say this is some conspiracy theory lol. Open your eyes people..

I think you're romanticizing what they're doing in Sweden. There was a good comment earlier from a Swede who said the government has asked people to stay home and it's largely shut down and people are getting laid off because of it. They just rely more on people doing what they ask instead of legislation.

Real glad we‚Äôre seeing some progress in Europe but the second wave hitting East Asia needs way more attention. Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan amongst others are/were seeing huge increases in confirmed cases in a very short time span. Just like earlier this year we can‚Äôt do the same mistake by narrowly looking at developments in Europe.

Why would they release it in their own heartland instead of doing it in say the US? Not to mention that China's exports plummeted to (IIRC) 40% of its pre-crisis number, and they absolutely do rely on their partners being economically healthy in order to further their own growth optimally..

Literally nothing should be 'ruled out', if you want to go down that path.

Yes, I don‚Äôt think you realize how much of the average executive‚Äôs wealth is tied up in assets which are dependent on the value of their company, when we say that someone is rich that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they have millions of dollars in cash that they can spend at any time, for most rich people the vast majority of their net worth is in investments they can‚Äôt retrieve in a pinch

I know that. I've always despised headlines depicting CEO's bank account matching their companies market cap. You know China manufacturers most of our goods right? And our medicines? And many foods? You're telling me China doesn't benefit at all from the United States being economically weak? I know you're not that dense.

I don't mind a well thought conspiracy (for fun purposes only), but this one just doesn't sit in well with me.

If the CCP wanted to release the virus intentionally, why did they start it at their country? Why didn't they start it directly in the US or Europe? Or even Latin America or Africa etc..then as time passes by, then they infect themselves at a random time to muddy the waters..nobody would be suspicious of them if they did that.

Starting it at Wuhan raises many red flags which they didn't need to raise.

Thinking out loud here....

Every projection/plan I've read has focused on there needing to be a Phase 2 of the pandemic. Phase 1 involves social distancing and flatten the curve to buy time for production of hospitals and supplies and the plans created and implemented for Phase 2. This is where we are now.

Phase 2 involves A) GPS tracking everywhere we go to know if we came into contact with an active infection and have a need to self quarantine again along with everyone else who crossed that path B) repeated Nationwide testing every couple weeks or C) some combo of the two.

At this point I think it's a waste of time to ask when quarantine will be over without having a meaningful discussion of what over means, and what we can expect/plan for Phase 2.

Phase 2 would likely include the GPS tracking, but I foresee a law against violating this. Laws would have to be written and passed to enforce this.

But then again, if there was a 30 day national lockdown this would almost be over. Instead, there's no lockdown and they'd rather take up time creating tracking apps. What a waste of resources.

Apparently there are only around 16k deaths worldwide in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa.

The population of these places is around 7 billions.

Meanwhile, in US, Can, Aus, EU which are supposedly the most developed countries in the world..there are over 96k deaths. Despite having a population of around 0.7 billion or so.

This doesn't add up..and before anyone says "people travel a lot to the west" etc..they also do all over the world, there are lots of tourist hotspots all over Asia and Latin America etc, so this isn't really a reasonable take.

If we match the figures to those in the west, the deaths should already be at 1 million or so if I'm being generous.

We shouldn't forget out some other countries have worse healthcare and living standards, so you'd expect the death rates to be ever higher, but I'm not getting into that.

Conclusion is, the numbers mean shit, even in western countries btw because every country has different criteria to what counts as a Covid 19 death and what doesn't.

Some random on twitter claimed that there was an age threshold of 26 on the stimulus bill and that college students filing independent wouldn‚Äôt receive the check either. There‚Äôs no credibility to this, right?

If that was true it would have been widely reported because a minimum age of 26 would be insanely controversial

Yes you should. You are paying taxes just like anyone else and not ‚Äúsupported‚Äù by anyone.

The whole 26 age thing is because that is the age you can keep your child on taxes and health insurance.

If no one is claiming you as dependent your fine. The weirdest gap exists for kids who are 16-17. They‚Äôre too old to qualify for the $500 child stimulus and can‚Äôt get one for their own wages because they‚Äôre dependents.

My dad's a plumber. (NY) He just came home and talked about someone down the road dying of coronavirus. He then mentioned he just went to that same persons house to fix their toilet and that's when he found out. God we are so f***ed.

It's not a death sentence. If you're not over 80 you have a very small chance of dying from the virus. So first you have a small chance of actually catching the virus and on top of that a very small chance of actually dying. You're going to be fine.

Did I/we have corvid-19 in the past? I didn‚Äôt think much of it in early March or late February since there there was a flu outbreak but after talking to some people just yesterday with very similar freak symptoms I had I can help to wonder. It I had a sore throat and cough, typical right? Wait made it hard though is it made it hard to eat or drink. And what made those all minor was the DAMN pain in back of my head and feeling so confused. I had migraines but it didn‚Äôt happen there and it didn‚Äôt felt like that, and it didn‚Äôt last all day. It was agonizing, I had to go to ER. They gave me the most expensive flu test ever it seems, gave me tamaflu with stuff for my head. I was still bed ridden from the pain for a couple of days though. Seemed like I test positive the flu though though I got my shot. But it was so much everything else, but my head.

Now I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I had a history of migraines despite being in a different part and feeling standby and making me even cringe and jerk a bit. It came and went for some reason. What‚Äôs the wierd thing is I was talking to people and they had the EXACT the same thing. The time range, believing to have the flu, the back of the head pain, throat pain, even them going to er because of the extensive amount of time of head pain.

But could just be a odd thing with a flu because it was still flu season. But flu testing was oddly expensive (for me they charged me $400 since I mentioned my family had the flu).

Am I just overthinking?

I would say ‚Äúok cool‚Äù and leave it at that but even with been just the flu it was definitely more than a ache, and I had plenty of those. It was at minor like a electric stabbing and at worst... very odd description but somehow it comes to my head: felt like my right occipital(?) was being scrunch up like a piece of lunch meat then being constantly stabbed by a hot knife and shocking the back of my head to my neck making do little jerks in pain in every big stab.

Yeah overly discriptive I suppose but I‚Äôm still wondering wtf to this day. Thinking about makes my neck stiff

Well it well it was still flu season so it‚Äôs hard to tell unless tested, I know experience people can feel like shit virally without fever. The main reason I asked is that effect multiple people back of the head and neck specificly and and corvid is known to cause spinal issues. But I tested positive for flu I don‚Äôt know maybe it was a freak one

Sorry to say, but then it's fair that your neighbours are pissed at you. You're creating extra risk for both households and neighbourhoods by moving around (if that's what you're doing).

Pick one and stay there aside from going for a run or groceries.

You're not really giving the full picture in your original question either. You're implying that there's only one place of residence.

There was a really interesting article by BBC that recounted the day of an EMS worker in NYC. He was present for 12 cardiac arrest deaths during his 1 shift that all had obvious symptoms of the virus. But because none of them were properly tested, none were part of either the case or death count.

Usually he would be present for 3-4 cardiac arrests calls per week. All but one of his calls that day were cardiac arrests. And the total EMS call volume every single day is greater than the volume during 9/11. Every. Day.

Yah from what I have heard if an elderly person passes from flu like symptoms it gets recorded as a death from the flu. I wonder how many people died from covid before we even really took its seriously.

That being said I‚Äôm very curious how many people have actually been infected because 1.8 million seems many many many times too low considering how infective this is supposed to be.

If this had an RO of 3 wouldn‚Äôt that mean in a month it should have infected 3 to the power of 30?

that's overall, each person who gets sick on average gives it to 3 others but that's spread over a period of time. i chose to make my period in days. you can change that exponent to 30 if you want or 6 or something and just tweak the number till you get the 1.8 million again to figure out the relevant percentage.

3.9510.5 is close to 1.8 million so that's each person spreading it to 4 people over a course of 2 weeks, if my math is right

317.3 is also close so that would be an R0 of 3 over a span of about 9 days one is infectious...i'd lean towards the first amount though

I‚Äôm from Ontario alright. So according to our stats the first coronavirus case arrived January 25th 2020. Our social distancing and shut down of none essential business didn‚Äôt start until mid march.

People still went to saint Patrick‚Äôs day parties.

Just over 50 days since people started taking this seriously after it arrived to canada. Shouldn‚Äôt more than 6000 people infected in ontario if the RO is as high as they say?

1.1950 leads to that number

so does 3.477 so that's multiplying by 3.5 every week...i'd say you're right "on track" to have the same R0 unless the curve gets flattened

3.5 is higher than 2-3...

if you're referring to the 1.19....RO is over the lifetime of the sickness. i chose a daily value, but see my other comments around this to get some weekly/biweekly kind of values which would be more representative of a period of contagion

R0 assumes no mitigation and is the reproduction rate at the beginning right? As the virus spreads r0 drops as there are less available hosts that aren't immune. As we introduce measures such as social distancing it drops as well right?

yes, but there's no way in hell i'm doing the math more than i need to haha

i mean it's not that hard, just do an R0 for each 10x growth, there's sites that have done that already and others calculate the doubling time needed, which is just a function of the R0

It's less about did it work and more about how well did it work. People are staying in, but some people also are going between their friend's and family's houses too. They're not coming into contact with as many different people as they used to before, but some are still coming into contact with others outside their household (excluding essential service interactions).

I think the true indicator is how long we stall at this plateau. If we hang around 1500-2000 daily deaths in the US for a month or more, that shows we're not doing the best job. But if we drop a lot quicker, it shows people are really staying put the best they can.

Anyone who has bad asthma, or had pneumonia or extremely bad bronchitis, or partially drowned, or been partially strangled, can tell you that fighting for air and not getting it is painful. Also scary to terrifying, depending on how difficult it is to get your next breath, how exhausted you are, and if you expect to live or not.

If you are on a ventilator you will be sedated and should not feel anything. The difficulty to breath part is really uncomfortable though.

Slime in the back of the throat linked to the virus or just a cold? I dont have to cough at all but I got some slime/phlegm in the back of my throat so I have to scrape my throat sometimes, combined with a runny nose

It's time to get back to work and adopt Swedish model. They COVID hysteria needs to end soon. It's killing jobs and causing major disruptions in people's lives ONLY to flatten the curve. The area under the curve is the same. We saved the healthcare system. Military ships are sitting idly. Same number will die one way or another.

Those days to peak change just like estimated deaths. Deaths estimated for USA went from over a million to less than 60K. Stop the hysteria. Get back to work.

These articles from U.S. liberals blaming Europe for America's coronavirus cases are extremely tiresome. Europe was a victim of China's original dishonesty surrounding the disease -- punishing the whistleblower doctor and denying human-to-human transmission -- and should not be treated as morally equivalent to China in terms of blame for this global catastrophe.

What should Europe have done? Banned all Chinese nationals from entering Europe in early January? If so, the "European xenophobes" trope would have been dished out by Americans in response. Should Trump have banned flights from Europe in January? If so, U.S. liberals would have absolutely flipped out, given that there was minimal evidence of spread in Europe at the time.

This catastrophe isn't Europe's fault and it's not the United States' fault -- it's the CCP's fault for (yet again!) trying to cover up a public health issue.

Quite unlikely, especially if they were not talking in your specific direction. Right now it is only considered an exposure if you spent more than 15min in their sphere, unless they actively coughed or sneezed on you I would not worry too much about it. Take care

So I don‚Äôt know if I should be concerned about this or I‚Äôm just freaking myself out. I usually run between 15 to 20 miles per week, but I stopped completely ever since the whole covid 19 chaos started. This week I started running again and I noticed a very strange pain in my lungs. I don‚Äôt have a temperature and I don‚Äôt feel any pain when I‚Äôm not working out, but when I‚Äôm running I do feel it! I think it‚Äôs not pain per se, but more like soreness while I‚Äôm breathing.

Could be this signs of Covid? I had never felt this before and I‚Äôm pretty active and healthy.

My question is how many people have died from taking hydroxychloroquine and what was the cause of death? I get the feeling nobody because the people who wrote about the death from the fish tank cleaner version some people took probably would have jumped all over a case of the prescribed drug causing a death. Do you know many psychiatric drugs have the same warnings about heart rhythm abnormalities and the like..I wonder if there is much difference between the risks they speak of in the chloroquine and psych drugs..A good editor for a newspaper or news program would do a thorough analysis of the drug and exactly what has happened to people taking it as well as how many people have died from taking it now (and how many people have likely died from not taking it)

Why do you think hydroxychloroquine works for Covid-19? There are no scientific studies to support it. Yet. As someone who has been taking it for two years for lupus, it is a wonderful drug, but can cause significant side-effects. And it takes weeks or months for it to be effective.

Plus it is becoming more difficult for people like me to get this life-saving drug. Hoping something will work is not a rational strategy. Wait for the test results before recommending this.

a google search will tell you otherwise, choose your favorite source. hidden among the over 300 times fox news has advocated it are stories about people dying from it. seems like that would lead to them toning back a bit but i guess not

The FDA doesn‚Äôt require warnings in prescribing information just for fun. There‚Äôs data backing up all the warnings and contraindications and precautions. If there are enough deaths then the FDA requires a black box warning, hydroxychloroquinine isn‚Äôt at that level, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt a real prescribing risk for some patients. Especially since COVID19 is an off label use.

well they don't prescribe this drug "just for fun" it is to fight off an illness that would otherwise kill them..from what i understand if you don't take a treatment like this it stays in many people's systems at a adequate viral load for 3 or more weeks which is why a lot of these people get these sudden rapid declines later on...the virus hangs around and eventually finds a way to worm itself into a fatal outcome for you..the drug removes the virus from your system before it has a chance to do that

From what I‚Äôve read hydrochloroquine isn‚Äôt removing the virus. It has been shown to possibly inhibit viral activity in vitro, but the more promising effect has been as an anti-inflammatory for the treatment of cytokine storms. Cytokine storms may be responsible for the deaths we are seeing in younger people, so finding a treatment for that is good, but there are other drugs that also show promise in that area. I‚Äôve been reading pre-pubs as I become aware of them, but I‚Äôm not in viral research, so do your own research. Nothing I‚Äôve read indicates it‚Äôs removing virus from anyone‚Äôs body.

My comment about fun was directed toward the skepticism I‚Äôm seeing about the real side effects and poor outcomes some patients have with the drug. I get it, people want a miracle drug, and I hope it does more good than harm, but there is probably a portion of sick people that will have dangerous side effects, especially if it‚Äôs being widely prescribed. That‚Äôs why people smarter than me are counseling caution and the need for more research and data.

they have done research where it rapidly decreased the viral load in patients and if it is only good for cytokine storms how come people taking it for lupus don't get the virus in the first place?

You think local, state, and federal governments can continue to pay people a nice unemployment check forever while having everything closed not being able to collect any taxes? Everything that gets provided by tax payer money will soon be gone if they can‚Äôt earn any money.

Yea and how would that change anything? Money doesn‚Äôt come from no where. The government still needs to collect in taxes to be able to pay people in a UBI system.

You realize that UBI is not supposed to make it so that people don't have to work or do anything with their life? It's not a free pass for you to be a lazy waste of space. It's supposed to help on top of you working and having a job.

You can‚Äôt tax money if it isn‚Äôt moving though, and it‚Äôs moving very little at the moment. I guess you could do a negative interest rate in savings above x amount of money but that money will probably go to a different country.

It‚Äôs not viable legislation, it will get killed by the GOP because it‚Äôs aggressively against their platform, and dems aren‚Äôt going to sweep this election so there will not be UBI legislation passed in the US until at least 2025

Hello, I just want some advice and opinions. Feel free to be harsh and what not. I live in California.

I planned a trip with one member of my household and two other friends from a different household (4 ppl total), back in January before the world began to halt. We plan on driving down in our personal cars. Staying at an AirBnB. Is this a bad idea? I have other members of the family pressuring me to cancel and I‚Äôm not sure exactly how this will pan out.

I know my friends are being very responsible about being socially distant, but I do understand there is slight risks to going.

Trip is planned for beginning of May.

What do you guys think?

Edit: Cancelled.

A lot of AirBnBs are actually closed. Have you spoken to them? Can you not schedule a latter time?

Tbh, this is kind of how outbreaks flare up. The quarantine gets eased and people run around meeting up and suddenly it all goes a bit sideways. One person is sick or asymptotic - they go to a new area, stop at a gas station, stop for a coffee and another stop for some supplies. Either they pick it up from someone or give it to someone.

you are weak if you can't handle a little isolation. You would never survive in the big house. Shut ins get a lot of flack usually but reality is they are thriving now being the most prepared.

Is the curve flattening theory is a fallacy?

So we are trying not to overwhelm our health system until we get it ready to accept large numbers of Coronavirus sufferers.

Here is the problem with that. Let's say one percent of the population are susceptible to being killed by the virus due to bad health. We have a lock down for a year and all survive. Meanwhile, we get our hospitals ready to accept one percent of the population. So in the second year we can release the lock down because we are ready for the surge of victims, right?

Wrong! In the second year another one percent of the population get to the point in their lives where they are susceptible to the virus. So now we have to have another lock down while we prepare the health system to accept those that didn't die last year and the newly susceptible.

I have over simplified, but you can feed in different numbers and still see the problem.

Lockdown is only a way to get ready for the pandemic. Spain and Austria are opening back up today. Once equipment and plans are drawn up, only the most at risk will be isolating. Then later once a vaccine is ready they will be allowed back out. Lockdown for 1 year is something that certainly won‚Äôt happen.

You seem unclear about the term lockdown. And unclear about the fact that we WILL need a form of "lockdown" untill a cure an vaccine are found. How that form will be is somewhat unclear. Some say we never shake hands again and will be washing hands 24/7. Some will say we will be 6ft society for the foreseeable future. So yes. We need a indefinite "lockdown". No f-ing way around it.

No, it doesn't. Heat does. But paper doesn't get hot when you put it in the microwave so this is useless. Just open your mail and then wash your hands if you're worried, but really, getting it from mail is incredibly unlikely.

The Covid virus only last for about 3 hours on print paper, just wash your hands after picking them up, leave them alone for a while, and proceed normally. Microwaving is probably not helpful. https://covidpapers.github.io/posts/stability-of-sars-cov-2-in-different-environmental-conditions/#.XooRVhkGU04.reddit

Microwaving works by heating up water molecules, and there is no radiation, only heat. It would not work on a dry mask.

The mail and paper generally have some moisture on them where I live. They get dried out in the microwave. Lately I have been "cooking" the mail and the paper at 170 F for a half hour because that is the lowest my oven goes. Paper burns at Fahrenheit 451 so it is safe. Apparently Coronavirus dies at 135F after a half hour.
